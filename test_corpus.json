        "transcript": "About 10 years ago, I took on the task\nto teach global developmentAnd I put them together\nso that in each pair of countries,(Laughter)But one late night,\nwhen I was compiling the report,(Laughter)Because the chimpanzee\nwould score half rightI did also an unethical study(Laughter)This is where I realized that\nthere was really a need to communicate,So we did this software,\nwhich displays it like this.(Laughter)And they said, \"The world\nis still 'we' and 'them.'So this is what I could display here.Let's see. We stopped the world then.In the '80s here, you have Bangladesh\nstill among the African countries.(Applause)(Applause ends)Let me make a comparison directlySo let's move over to another way hereWe heard it in other forms.And what did it look like\nif we go back in time,Of course it's a logarithmic scale here,But let me split sub-Saharan Africa.There's a huge difference [within] Africa.Data is often better than you think.\nMany people say data is bad.And we get the whole pattern\nhere of the world,But I would like to bring you back\nto about here, at 1960.And if we move back again, here,\nand we put trails on them, like this,Now, this is, more or less, if you look\nat the average data of the countries --And even more, policy makers\nand the corporate sectorsAll that information\nwe saw changing in the world(Laughter)And this won't work.(Applause)So what is needed? We have the databases.Some countries accept that\ntheir databases can go out on the world.But this is what we would\nlike to see, isn't it?(Laughter)And that's a quite clever guy, huh?(Laughter)So we can see a lot happening\nin data in the coming years.(Laughter)It's pretty scary.(Laughter)But I think it's very important\nto have all this information.I end now with the world.Thank you very much.(Applause)"
