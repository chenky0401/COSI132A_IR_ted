        "transcript": "Good morning. How are you? (Audience) Good. It's been great, hasn't it? I've been blown away by the whole thing. In fact, I'm leaving. (Laughter) There have been three themes\nrunning through the conference, which are relevant\nto what I want to talk about. One is the extraordinary\nevidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here; just the variety of it\nand the range of it. The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea\nwhat's going to happen in terms of the future. No idea how this may play out. I have an interest in education. Actually, what I find is,\neverybody has an interest in education. Don't you? I find this very interesting. If you're at a dinner party,\nand you say you work in education -- actually, you're not often\nat dinner parties, frankly. (Laughter) If you work in education,\nyou're not asked. (Laughter) And you're never asked back, curiously.\nThat's strange to me. But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, \"What do you do?\" and you say you work in education, you can see the blood run from their face. They're like, \"Oh my God. Why me?\" (Laughter) \"My one night out all week.\" (Laughter) But if you ask about their education,\nthey pin you to the wall, because it's one of those things\nthat goes deep with people, am I right? Like religion and money and other things. So I have a big interest in education,\nand I think we all do. We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it's education\nthat's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. If you think of it, children starting school this year\nwill be retiring in 2065. Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that's been\non parade for the past four days, what the world will look like\nin five years' time. And yet, we're meant\nto be educating them for it. So the unpredictability,\nI think, is extraordinary. And the third part of this\nis that we've all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary\ncapacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation. I mean, Sirena last night\nwas a marvel, wasn't she? Just seeing what she could do. And she's exceptional, but I think\nshe's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood. What you have there is a person\nof extraordinary dedication who found a talent. And my contention is,\nall kids have tremendous talents, and we squander them, pretty ruthlessly. So I want to talk about education, and I want to talk about creativity. My contention is that creativity now\nis as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it\nwith the same status. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) That was it, by the way.\nThank you very much. (Laughter) So, 15 minutes left. (Laughter) \"Well, I was born ... \" (Laughter) I heard a great story recently --\nI love telling it -- of a little girl\nwho was in a drawing lesson. She was six, and she was\nat the back, drawing, and the teacher said this girl\nhardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did. The teacher was fascinated. She went over to her,\nand she said, \"What are you drawing?\" And the girl said,\n\"I'm drawing a picture of God.\" And the teacher said, \"But nobody\nknows what God looks like.\" And the girl said,\n\"They will in a minute.\" (Laughter) When my son was four in England -- actually, he was four\neverywhere, to be honest. (Laughter) If we're being strict about it,\nwherever he went, he was four that year. He was in the Nativity play.\nDo you remember the story? (Laughter) No, it was big, it was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel,\nyou may have seen it. (Laughter) \"Nativity II.\" But James got the part of Joseph,\nwhich we were thrilled about. We considered this to be\none of the lead parts. We had the place crammed\nfull of agents in T-shirts: \"James Robinson IS Joseph!\" (Laughter) He didn't have to speak, but you know\nthe bit where the three kings come in? They come in bearing gifts,\ngold, frankincense and myrrh. This really happened. We were sitting there, and I think\nthey just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy\nafterward and said, \"You OK with that?\" They said,\n\"Yeah, why? Was that wrong?\" They just switched. The three boys came in, four-year-olds\nwith tea towels on their heads. They put these boxes down, and the first\nboy said, \"I bring you gold.\" And the second boy said,\n\"I bring you myrrh.\" And the third boy said, \"Frank sent this.\" (Laughter) What these things have in common\nis that kids will take a chance. If they don't know, they'll have a go. Am I right? They're not\nfrightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong\nis the same thing as being creative. What we do know is,\nif you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up\nwith anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults,\nmost kids have lost that capacity. They have become\nfrightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running\nnational education systems where mistakes are the worst\nthing you can make. And the result is that\nwe are educating people out of their creative capacities. Picasso once said this, he said\nthat all children are born artists. The problem is to remain\nan artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately,\nthat we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out of it. So why is this? I lived in Stratford-on-Avon\nuntil about five years ago. In fact, we moved from Stratford\nto Los Angeles. So you can imagine\nwhat a seamless transition this was. (Laughter) Actually, we lived in a place\ncalled Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where\nShakespeare's father was born. Are you struck by a new thought? I was. You don't think of Shakespeare\nhaving a father, do you? Do you? Because you don't think\nof Shakespeare being a child, do you? Shakespeare being seven? I never thought of it. I mean, he was seven at some point. He was in somebody's\nEnglish class, wasn't he? (Laughter) How annoying would that be? (Laughter) \"Must try harder.\" (Laughter) Being sent to bed by his dad,\nto Shakespeare, \"Go to bed, now!\" To William Shakespeare. \"And put the pencil down!\" (Laughter) \"And stop speaking like that.\" (Laughter) \"It's confusing everybody.\" (Laughter) Anyway, we moved\nfrom Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word\nabout the transition. Actually, my son didn't want to come. I've got two kids;\nhe's 21 now, my daughter's 16. He didn't want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it, but he had\na girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life, Sarah. He'd known her for a month. (Laughter) Mind you, they'd had\ntheir fourth anniversary, because it's a long time when you're 16. He was really upset on the plane. He said, \"I'll never find\nanother girl like Sarah.\" And we were rather pleased\nabout that, frankly -- (Laughter) because she was the main reason\nwe were leaving the country. (Laughter) But something strikes you\nwhen you move to America and travel around the world: every education system on earth\nhas the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. Doesn't matter where you go. You'd think it would be\notherwise, but it isn't. At the top are mathematics and languages,\nthen the humanities. At the bottom are the arts.\nEverywhere on earth. And in pretty much every system, too,\nthere's a hierarchy within the arts. Art and music are normally given\na higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an education\nsystem on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why? Why not? I think this is rather important. I think math is very important,\nbut so is dance. Children dance all the time\nif they're allowed to, we all do. We all have bodies, don't we?\nDid I miss a meeting? (Laughter) Truthfully, what happens is,\nas children grow up, we start to educate them progressively\nfrom the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side. If you were to visit education as an alien and say \"What's it for, public education?\" I think you'd have to conclude,\nif you look at the output, who really succeeds by this, who does everything they should, who gets all the brownie points,\nwho are the winners -- I think you'd have to conclude\nthe whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors. Isn't it? They're the people who come out the top. And I used to be one, so there. (Laughter) And I like university professors, but, you know, we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark\nof all human achievement. They're just a form of life. Another form of life. But they're rather curious. And I say this out of affection for them: there's something curious\nabout professors. In my experience -- not all of them,\nbut typically -- they live in their heads. They live up there\nand slightly to one side. They're disembodied, you know,\nin a kind of literal way. They look upon their body as a form\nof transport for their heads. (Laughter) Don't they? It's a way of getting\ntheir head to meetings. (Laughter) If you want real evidence\nof out-of-body experiences, by the way, get yourself along to a residential\nconference of senior academics and pop into the discotheque\non the final night. (Laughter) And there, you will see it. Grown men and women\nwrithing uncontrollably, off the beat. (Laughter) Waiting until it ends, so they can\ngo home and write a paper about it. (Laughter) Our education system is predicated\non the idea of academic ability. And there's a reason. Around the world, there were\nno public systems of education, really, before the 19th century. They all came into being\nto meet the needs of industrialism. So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas. Number one, that the most useful\nsubjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away\nfrom things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds you would never\nget a job doing that. Is that right? \"Don't do music, you're not\ngoing to be a musician; don't do art, you won't be an artist.\" Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken. The whole world\nis engulfed in a revolution. And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate\nour view of intelligence, because the universities design\nthe system in their image. If you think of it, the whole system of public education\naround the world is a protracted process of university entrance. And the consequence is\nthat many highly talented, brilliant, creative people\nthink they're not, because the thing\nthey were good at at school wasn't valued,\nor was actually stigmatized. And I think we can't afford\nto go on that way. In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be\ngraduating through education than since the beginning of history. More people. And it's the combination\nof all the things we've talked about: technology and its\ntransformational effect on work, and demography and the huge\nexplosion in population. Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. Isn't that true? When I was a student,\nif you had a degree, you had a job. If you didn't have a job,\nit's because you didn't want one. And I didn't want one, frankly. (Laughter) But now kids with degrees\nare often heading home to carry on playing video games, because you need an MA\nwhere the previous job required a BA, and now you need a PhD for the other. It's a process of academic inflation. And it indicates the whole structure\nof education is shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically rethink\nour view of intelligence. We know three things about intelligence. One, it's diverse. We think about the world in all the ways\nthat we experience it. We think visually, we think in sound,\nwe think kinesthetically. We think in abstract terms,\nwe think in movement. Secondly, intelligence is dynamic. If you look at the interactions\nof a human brain, as we heard yesterday\nfrom a number of presentations, intelligence is wonderfully interactive. The brain isn't divided into compartments. In fact, creativity -- which I define as the process of having\noriginal ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different\ndisciplinary ways of seeing things. By the way, there's a shaft of nerves\nthat joins the two halves of the brain, called the corpus callosum. It's thicker in women. Following off from Helen yesterday, this is probably why women\nare better at multitasking. Because you are, aren't you? There's a raft of research,\nbut I know it from my personal life. If my wife is cooking a meal\nat home, which is not often ... thankfully. (Laughter) No, she's good at some things. But if she's cooking,\nshe's dealing with people on the phone, she's talking to the kids,\nshe's painting the ceiling -- (Laughter) she's doing open-heart surgery over here. If I'm cooking, the door\nis shut, the kids are out, the phone's on the hook, if she comes in, I get annoyed. I say, \"Terry, please,\nI'm trying to fry an egg in here.\" (Laughter) \"Give me a break.\" (Laughter) Actually, do you know\nthat old philosophical thing, \"If a tree falls in a forest,\nand nobody hears it, did it happen?\" Remember that old chestnut? I saw a great T-shirt\nrecently, which said, \"If a man speaks his mind in a forest,\nand no woman hears him, is he still wrong?\" (Laughter) And the third thing about intelligence is, it's distinct. I'm doing a new book at the moment\ncalled \"Epiphany,\" which is based on a series\nof interviews with people about how they discovered their talent. I'm fascinated by\nhow people got to be there. It's really prompted by a conversation\nI had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people\nhave never heard of, Gillian Lynne. Have you heard of her? Some have. She's a choreographer,\nand everybody knows her work. She did \"Cats\" and \"Phantom of the Opera.\" She's wonderful. I used to be on the board\nof The Royal Ballet, as you can see. (Laughter) Gillian and I had lunch one day.\nI said, \"How did you get to be a dancer?\" It was interesting. When she was at school,\nshe was really hopeless. And the school, in the '30s,\nwrote to her parents and said, \"We think Gillian\nhas a learning disorder.\" She couldn't concentrate;\nshe was fidgeting. I think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you? But this was the 1930s, and ADHD\nhadn't been invented at this point. It wasn't an available condition. (Laughter) People weren't aware they could have that. (Laughter) Anyway, she went to see this specialist. So, this oak-paneled room,\nand she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat\non this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes, while this man talked to her mother about all the problems\nGillian was having at school, because she was disturbing people,\nher homework was always late, and so on. Little kid of eight. In the end, the doctor went\nand sat next to Gillian and said, \"I've listened to all these\nthings your mother's told me. I need to speak to her privately. Wait here. We'll be back.\nWe won't be very long,\" and they went and left her. But as they went out of the room, he turned on the radio\nthat was sitting on his desk. And when they got out of the room, he said to her mother,\n\"Just stand and watch her.\" And the minute they left the room, she was on her feet, moving to the music. And they watched for a few minutes,\nand he turned to her mother and said, \"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick. She's a dancer. Take her to a dance school.\" I said, \"What happened?\" She said, \"She did. I can't tell you\nhow wonderful it was. We walked in this room,\nand it was full of people like me -- people who couldn't sit still, people who had to move to think.\" Who had to move to think. They did ballet, they did tap, jazz;\nthey did modern; they did contemporary. She was eventually auditioned\nfor the Royal Ballet School. She became a soloist; she had\na wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated\nfrom the Royal Ballet School, founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company, met Andrew Lloyd Webber. She's been responsible for some of the most successful\nmusical theater productions in history, she's given pleasure to millions, and she's a multimillionaire. Somebody else might have put her\non medication and told her to calm down. (Applause) What I think it comes to is this: Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution\nthat was triggered by Rachel Carson. I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception\nof human ecology, one in which we start\nto reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth\nfor a particular commodity. And for the future, it won't serve us. We have to rethink\nthe fundamental principles on which we're educating our children. There was a wonderful quote\nby Jonas Salk, who said, \"If all the insects\nwere to disappear from the Earth, within 50 years,\nall life on Earth would end. If all human beings\ndisappeared from the Earth, within 50 years,\nall forms of life would flourish.\" And he's right. What TED celebrates is the gift\nof the human imagination. We have to be careful now\nthat we use this gift wisely, and that we avert some of the scenarios\nthat we've talked about. And the only way we'll do it\nis by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children\nfor the hope that they are. And our task is to educate\ntheir whole being, so they can face this future. By the way -- we may not see this future, but they will. And our job is to help them\nmake something of it. Thank you very much. (Applause)",

When we grow up, we become frightened for being wrong and in the school system, mistakes are the worst thing you can make. But isn't school supposed to prepare us for the future? The knowledge we gain from school matters but creativity is still necessary. Students spend 18+ years in their lives taking tests, memorizing informations and spent hours finishing homeworks. However, true learning is born out of lasting understanding, not grades and tests. The informations we memorize fades by the time, but our creativity won\u2019t. In school, even if you\u2019re allowed to be creative, they put a lot of restrictions in it. Students are expected to follow methods instead of creating their own. For example, in Literature. Students are often given strict guidelines for writing things like poems. School makes us create poems that have precise rules for each individual line, making poetry seem very constricted and uncreative. School drains out creativity of oneself.That\u2019s why school must focus on empowering students\u2019 creativity.": {

I'm teaching myself how to code and build on a kid-friendly platform currently called ROBLOX, and can get paid for making games on it via \"Developer Exchange\". I nearly had a successful game as well, ended up getting around 65 thousand visits on the game, alongside having up to 40 people playing it at once, 20-30 on multiple special occasions. ROBLOX is just some kiddy game, but for me its a good starting point. If school isn't teaching me something that I should have remembered, then its obvious that its not important enough.\n\nAs time goes by, hopefully I can teach myself some skills via Blender modeling, Unreal engine, or even Unity engine.

        "transcript": "If you're here today -- and I'm very happy that you are -- you've all heard about\nhow sustainable development will save us from ourselves. However, when we're not at TED,\nwe are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda\nis just not feasible, especially in large urban areas\nlike New York City. And that's because most people\nwith decision-making powers, in both the public and the private sector, really don't feel\nas though they're in danger. The reason why I'm here today,\nin part, is because of a dog -- an abandoned puppy I found\nback in the rain, back in 1998. She turned out to be\na much bigger dog than I'd anticipated. When she came into my life, we were\nfighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront despite the fact that\nour small part of New York City already handled more than 40 percent\nof the entire city's commercial waste: a sewage treatment pelletizing plant,\na sewage sludge plant, four power plants, the world's largest\nfood-distribution center, as well as other industries that bring\nmore than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week. The area also has one of the lowest ratios\nof parks to people in the city. So when I was contacted\nby the Parks Department about a $10,000 seed-grant initiative\nto help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were really\nwell-meaning, but a bit naive. I'd lived in this area all my life,\nand you could not get to the river, because of all the lovely facilities\nthat I mentioned earlier. Then, while jogging\nwith my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought\nwas just another illegal dump. There were weeds and piles of garbage\nand other stuff that I won't mention here, but she kept dragging me, and lo and behold, at the end\nof that lot was the river. I knew that this forgotten\nlittle street-end, abandoned like the dog that brought\nme there, was worth saving. And I knew it would grow\nto become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization\nof the new South Bronx. And just like my new dog, it was an idea\nthat got bigger than I'd imagined. We garnered much support along the way, and the Hunts Point Riverside Park\nbecame the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had\nin more than 60 years. We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant\nmore than 300 times, into a $3 million park. And in the fall, I'm going to exchange\nmarriage vows with my beloved. (Audience whistles) Thank you very much. (Applause) That's him pressing my buttons\nback there, which he does all the time. (Laughter) (Applause) But those of us living\nin environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine. We feel the problems right now,\nand have for some time. Environmental justice, for those of you\nwho may not be familiar with the term, goes something like this: no community should be saddled\nwith more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits\nthan any other. Unfortunately, race and class\nare extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff,\nlike parks and trees, and where one might find the bad stuff,\nlike power plants and waste facilities. As a black person in America,\nI am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution\nposes the greatest risk to my health. I am five times more likely\nto live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility, which I do. These land-use decisions\ncreated the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity,\ndiabetes and asthma. Why would someone leave their home to go\nfor a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood? Our 27 percent obesity rate\nis high even for this country, and diabetes comes with it. One out of four South Bronx\nchildren has asthma. Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher\nthan the national average. These impacts are coming everyone's way. And we all pay dearly\nfor solid waste costs, health problems associated\nwith pollution and more odiously, the cost of imprisoning\nour young black and Latino men, who possess untold amounts\nof untapped potential. Fifty percent of our residents\nlive at or below the poverty line; 25 percent of us are unemployed. Low-income citizens often use\nemergency-room visits as primary care. This comes at a high cost to taxpayers\nand produces no proportional benefits. Poor people are not only still poor,\nthey are still unhealthy. Fortunately, there are many people\nlike me who are striving for solutions that won't compromise the lives of low-income communities of color\nin the short term, and won't destroy us all in the long term. None of us want that,\nand we all have that in common. So what else do we have in common? Well, first of all,\nwe're all incredibly good-looking. (Laughter) Graduated high school, college,\npost-graduate degrees, traveled to interesting places,\ndidn't have kids in your early teens, financially stable, never been imprisoned. OK. Good. (Laughter) But, besides being a black woman, I am different from most of you\nin some other ways. I watched nearly half of the buildings\nin my neighborhood burn down. My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam, only to be gunned down\na few blocks from our home. Jesus. I grew up with a crack house\nacross the street. Yeah, I'm a poor black child\nfrom the ghetto. These things make me different from you. But the things we have in common set me apart from most\nof the people in my community, and I am in between these two worlds with enough of my heart\nto fight for justice in the other. So how did things get so different for us? In the late '40s, my dad --\na Pullman porter, son of a slave -- bought a house in the Hunts Point\nsection of the South Bronx, and a few years later, he married my mom. At the time, the community was a mostly\nwhite, working-class neighborhood. My dad was not alone. And as others like him pursued\ntheir own version of the American dream, white flight became common\nin the South Bronx and in many cities around the country. Red-lining was used by banks,\nwherein certain sections of the city, including ours, were deemed\noff-limits to any sort of investment. Many landlords believed it was more\nprofitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather\nthan to sell under those conditions -- dead or injured former tenants\nnotwithstanding. Hunts Point was formerly\na walk-to-work community, but now residents had neither\nwork nor home to walk to. A national highway construction boom\nwas added to our problems. In New York State, Robert Moses spearheaded\nan aggressive highway-expansion campaign. One of its primary goals was\nto make it easier for residents of wealthy communities\nin Westchester County to go to Manhattan. The South Bronx, which lies in between,\ndid not stand a chance. Residents were often given\nless than a month's notice before their buildings were razed. 600,000 people were displaced. The common perception was that only pimps and pushers\nand prostitutes were from the South Bronx. And if you are told\nfrom your earliest days that nothing good is going to come\nfrom your community, that it's bad and ugly, how could it not reflect on you? So now, my family's property\nwas worthless, save for that it was our home,\nand all we had. And luckily for me, that home\nand the love inside of it, along with help from teachers, mentors\nand friends along the way, was enough. Now, why is this story important? Because from a planning perspective, economic degradation\nbegets environmental degradation, which begets social degradation. The disinvestment that began\nin the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental\ninjustices that were to come. Antiquated zoning and land-use\nregulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting\nfacilities in my neighborhood. Are these factors taken into consideration\nwhen land-use policy is decided? What costs are associated\nwith these decisions? And who pays? Who profits? Does anything justify\nwhat the local community goes through? This was \"planning\" -- in quotes -- that did not have\nour best interests in mind. Once we realized that, we decided\nit was time to do our own planning. That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building\na Greenway movement in the South Bronx. I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million\ndollar federal transportation grant to design the plan\nfor a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on-street bike paths. Physical improvements help inform\npublic policy regarding traffic safety, the placement of the waste\nand other facilities, which, if done properly, don't compromise\na community's quality of life. They provide opportunities\nto be more physically active, as well as local economic development. Think bike shops, juice stands. We secured 20 million dollars\nto build first-phase projects. This is Lafayette Avenue -- and that's redesigned\nby Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects. And once this path is constructed,\nit'll connect the South Bronx with more than 400 acres\nof Randall's Island Park. Right now we're separated by about 25 feet\nof water, but this link will change that. As we nurture the natural environment,\nits abundance will give us back even more. We run a project called the Bronx\n[Environmental] Stewardship Training, which provides job training in the fields\nof ecological restoration, so that folks from our community\nhave the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs. Little by little, we're seeding\nthe area with green-collar jobs -- and with people that have both\na financial and personal stake in their environment. The Sheridan Expressway\nis an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era, built with no regard for the neighborhoods\nthat were divided by it. Even during rush hour,\nit goes virtually unused. The community created\nan alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal\nof the highway. We have the opportunity now to bring\ntogether all the stakeholders to re-envision how this 28 acres\ncan be better utilized for parkland, affordable housing\nand local economic development. We also built New York City's first green\nand cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices. Cool roofs are highly-reflective\nsurfaces that don't absorb solar heat, and pass it on to\nthe building or atmosphere. Green roofs are soil and living plants. Both can be used instead\nof petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat, contribute\nto urban \"heat island\" effect and degrade under the sun, which we in turn breathe. Green roofs also retain\nup to 75 percent of rainfall, so they reduce a city's need to fund\ncostly end-of-pipe solutions -- which, incidentally, are often located in environmental justice\ncommunities like mine. And they provide habitats\nfor our little friends! [Butterfly] (Laughter) So cool! Anyway, the demonstration\nproject is a springboard for our own green roof\ninstallation business, bringing jobs and sustainable\neconomic activity to the South Bronx. [Green is the new black ...] (Laughter) (Applause) I like that, too. Anyway, I know Chris told us\nnot to do pitches up here, but since I have all of your attention: We need investors. End of pitch. It's better to ask\nfor forgiveness than permission. Anyway -- (Laughter) (Applause) OK. Katrina. Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx\nand New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common. Both were largely populated\nby poor people of color, both hotbeds of cultural innovation:\nthink hip-hop and jazz. Both are waterfront communities\nthat host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another. In the post-Katrina era,\nwe have still more in common. We're at best ignored,\nand maligned and abused, at worst, by negligent regulatory agencies,\npernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability. Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward\nnor the South Bronx was inevitable. But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out. We are more than simply\nnational symbols of urban blight or problems to be solved\nby empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone. Now will we let the Gulf Coast\nlanguish for a decade or two, like the South Bronx did? Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource\nof grassroots activists that have been born of desperation\nin communities like mine? Now listen, I do not expect individuals, corporations or government\nto make the world a better place because it is right or moral. This presentation today only represents\nsome of what I've been through. Like a tiny little bit. You've no clue. But I'll tell you later,\nif you want to know. (Laughter) But -- I know it's the bottom line,\nor one's perception of it, that motivates people in the end. I'm interested in what I like to call\nthe \"triple bottom line\" that sustainable development can produce. Developments that have the potential\nto create positive returns for all concerned:\nthe developers, government and the community\nwhere these projects go up. At present, that's not happening\nin New York City. And we are operating with a comprehensive\nurban-planning deficit. A parade of government subsidies is going to propose big-box and stadium\ndevelopments in the South Bronx, but there is scant coordination\nbetween city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects\nof increased traffic, pollution, solid waste and the impacts on open space. And their approaches to local economic\nand job development are so lame it's not even funny. Because on top of that, the world's richest sports team\nis replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two\nwell-loved community parks. Now, we'll have even less\nthan that stat I told you about earlier. And although less than 25 percent\nof South Bronx residents own cars, these projects include\nthousands of new parking spaces, yet zip in terms of mass public transit. Now, what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy,\nenvironmentally-challenged community, versus incorporating structural,\nsustainable changes. My agency is working closely\nwith Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues. Now let's get this straight:\nI am not anti-development. Ours is a city, not a wilderness preserve. And I've embraced my inner capitalist. And, but I don't have -- (Laughter) You probably all have,\nand if you haven't, you need to. (Laughter) So I don't have a problem\nwith developers making money. There's enough precedent out there\nto show that a sustainable, community-friendly development\ncan still make a fortune. Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough\nand Amory Lovins -- both heroes of mine by the way --\nhave shown that you can actually do that. I do have a problem\nwith developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable\ncommunities for profit. That it continues is a shame upon us all, because we are all responsible\nfor the future that we create. But one of the things I do\nto remind myself of greater possibilities, is to learn from visionaries\nin other cities. This is my version of globalization. Let's take Bogota. Poor, Latino, surrounded by\nrunaway gun violence and drug trafficking; a reputation not unlike\nthat of the South Bronx. However, this city was blessed\nin the late 1990s with a highly-influential\nmayor named Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa. He looked at the demographics. Few Bogotanos own cars, yet a huge portion of the city's resources\nwas dedicated to serving them. If you're a mayor, you can\ndo something about that. His administration narrowed key municipal\nthoroughfares from five lanes to three, outlawed parking on those streets, expanded pedestrian walkways\nand bike lanes, created public plazas, created one of the most efficient\nbus mass-transit systems in the entire world. For his brilliant efforts,\nhe was nearly impeached. But as people began to see\nthat they were being put first on issues reflecting\ntheir day-to-day lives, incredible things happened. People stopped littering. Crime rates dropped, because the streets\nwere alive with people. His administration attacked several\ntypical urban problems at one time, and on a third-world budget, at that. We have no excuse\nin this country, I'm sorry. But the bottom line is:\ntheir people-first agenda was not meant to penalize\nthose who could actually afford cars, but rather, to provide opportunities\nfor all Bogotanos to participate in the city's resurgence. That development should not come at the expense of the majority\nof the population is still considered\na radical idea here in the U.S. But Bogota's example\nhas the power to change that. You, however, are blessed\nwith the gift of influence. That's why you're here and why you\nvalue the information we exchange. Use your influence in support of comprehensive,\nsustainable change everywhere. Don't just talk about it at TED. This is a nationwide policy agenda\nI'm trying to build, and as you all know,\npolitics are personal. Help me make green the new black. Help me make sustainability sexy. Make it a part of your dinner\nand cocktail conversations. Help me fight for environmental\nand economic justice. Support investments\nwith a triple-bottom-line return. Help me democratize sustainability\nby bringing everyone to the table, and insisting that comprehensive\nplanning can be addressed everywhere. Oh good, glad I have a little more time! Listen -- when I spoke to Mr. Gore\nthe other day after breakfast, I asked him how environmental justice\nactivists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy. His response was a grant program. I don't think he understood\nthat I wasn't asking for funding. I was making him an offer. (Applause) What troubled me was that this\ntop-down approach is still around. Now, don't get me wrong, we need money. (Laughter) But grassroots groups\nare needed at the table during the decision-making process. Of the 90 percent of the energy\nthat Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day, don't add wasting our energy, intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count. (Applause) I have come from so far\nto meet you like this. Please don't waste me. By working together, we can become one of those small,\nrapidly-growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually\ncan change the world. We might have come to this conference from very, very different\nstations in life, but believe me, we all share\none incredibly powerful thing. We have nothing to lose\nand everything to gain. Ciao, bellos! (Applause)",

        "transcript": "(Music: \"The Sound of Silence,\"\nSimon &amp; Garfunkel) Hello voice mail, my old friend. (Laughter) I've called for tech support again. I ignored my boss's warning. I called on a Monday morning. Now it's evening, and my dinner\nfirst grew cold, and then grew mold. I'm still on hold. I'm listening to the sounds of silence. I don't think you understand. I think your phone lines are unmanned. I punched every touch tone I was told, but I've still spent 18 hours on hold. It's not enough your software\ncrashed my Mac, and it constantly hangs and bombs -- it erased my ROMs! Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence. In my dreams I fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys. Say your motorcycle crashes. Blood comes gushing from your gashes. With your fading strength, you call 9-1-1\nand you pray for a trained MD. But you get me. (Laughter) And you listen to the sounds of silence. (Music) (Applause) Thank you. Good evening and welcome to: \"Spot the TED Presenter Who Used\nto Be a Broadway Accompanist.\" (Laughter) When I was offered the Times\ncolumn six years ago, the deal was like this: you'll be sent the coolest, hottest,\nslickest new gadgets. Every week, it'll arrive at your door. You get to try them out,\nplay with them, evaluate them until the novelty wears out,\nbefore you have to send them back, and you'll get paid for it. You can think about it, if you want. So, I've always been a technology nut,\nand I absolutely love it. The job, though, came with one\nsmall downside, and that is, they intended to publish my email address\nat the end of every column. And what I've noticed is -- first of all,\nyou get an incredible amount of email. If you ever are feeling lonely, get a New York Times column, because you will get hundreds\nand hundreds and hundreds of emails. And the email I'm getting a lot\ntoday is about frustration. People are feeling like things -- Ok, I just had an alarm\ncome up on my screen. Lucky you can't see it. People are feeling overwhelmed. They're feeling like\nit's too much technology, too fast. It may be good technology, but I feel like there's not enough\nof a support structure. There's not enough help. There's not enough thought\nput into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use. One time I wrote a column about my efforts\nto reach Dell Technical Support, and within 12 hours,\nthere were 700 messages from readers on the feedback boards\non the Times website, from users saying, \"\"Me too, and here's my tale of woe.\" I call it \"software rage.\" And man, let me tell you, whoever figures out how to make money\noff of this frustration will -- Oh, how did that\nget up there? Just kidding. (Laughter) Ok, so why is the problem accelerating? And part of the problem is, ironically, because the industry\nhas put so much thought into making things easier to use. I'll show you what I mean. This is what the computer\ninterface used to look like, DOS. Over the years, it's gotten easier to use. This is the original Mac operating system. Reagan was President.\nMadonna was still a brunette. And the entire operating system -- this is the good part -- the entire\noperating system fit in 211 k. You couldn't put\nthe Mac OS X logo in 211 k! (Laughter) So the irony is, that as these\nthings became easier to use, a less technical, broader audience\nwas coming into contact with this equipment for the first time. I once had the distinct privilege\nof sitting in on the Apple call center for a day. The guy had a duplicate headset\nfor me to listen to. And the calls that --\nyou know how they say, \"Your call may be recorded\nfor quality assurance?\" Uh-uh. Your call may be recorded so that they can collect\nthe funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD. (Laughter) Which they do. (Laughter) And I have a copy. (Laughter) It's in your gift bag. No, no. With your voices on it! So, some of the stories are just\nso classic, and yet so understandable. A woman called Apple to complain\nthat her mouse was squeaking. Making a squeaking noise. And the technician said, \"Well, ma'am, what do you mean\nyour mouse is squeaking?\" She says, \"All I can tell you\nis that it squeaks louder, the faster I move it across the screen.\" (Laughter) And the technician's like, \"Ma'am, you've got the mouse\nup against the screen?\" She goes, \"Well, the message said,\n'Click here to continue.'\" (Laughter) Well, if you like that one --\nhow much time have we got? Another one, a guy called --\nthis is absolutely true -- his computer had crashed,\nand he told the technician he couldn't restart it, no matter\nhow many times he typed \"11.\" And the technician said,\n\"What? Why are you typing 11?\" He said, \"The message says,\n'Error Type 11.'\" (Laughter) So, we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely\nat the feet of the users. But why is the technical overload crisis, the complexity crisis, accelerating now? In the hardware world, it's because\nwe the consumers want everything to be smaller,\nsmaller, smaller. So the gadgets are getting\ntinier and tinier, but our fingers are essentially\nstaying the same size. So it gets to be more and more\nof a challenge. Software is subject\nto another primal force: the mandate to release\nmore and more versions. When you buy a piece of software, it's not like buying a vase\nor a candy bar, where you own it. It's more like joining a club,\nwhere you pay dues every year, and every year, they say, \"We've added more features,\nand we'll sell it to you for $99.\" I know one guy who's spent $4,000\njust on Photoshop over the years. And software companies make\n35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades. I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox -- which is that if you improve\na piece of software enough times, you eventually ruin it. I mean, Microsoft Word was last\njust a word processor in, you know, the Eisenhower administration. (Laughter) But what's the alternative? Microsoft actually did this experiment. They said, \"Well, wait a minute. Everyone complains that\nwe're adding so many features. Let's create a word processor\nthat's just a word processor: Simple, pure; does not do web pages,\nis not a database.\" And it came out,\nand it was called Microsoft Write. And none of you are nodding\nin acknowledgment, because it died. It tanked. No one ever bought it. I call this the Sport Utility Principle. People like to surround themselves\nwith unnecessary power, right? They don't need the database\nand the website, but they're like, \"Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might,\nyou know, I might need that someday.\" So the problem is: as you add more\nfeatures, where are they going to go? Where are you going to stick them?\nYou only have so many design tools. You can do buttons, you can do\nsliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus. But if you're not careful\nabout how you choose, you wind up with this. (Laughter) This is an un-retouched --\nthis is not a joke -- un-retouched photo of Microsoft Word, the copy that you have,\nwith all the toolbars open. You've obviously never\nopened all the toolbars, but all you have to type in\nis this little, teeny window down here. (Laughter) And we've arrived at the age\nof interface matrices, where there are so many\nfeatures and options, you have to do two dimensions, you know: a vertical and a horizontal. You guys all complain about how Microsoft Word\nis always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically. The off switch is in there somewhere. I'm telling you -- it's there. Part of the art of designing\na simple, good interface, is knowing when to use\nwhich one of these features. So, here is the log-off\ndialogue box for Windows 2000. There are only four choices, so why are they in a pop-up menu? It's not like the rest of the screen\nis so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices. They could have put them all out in view. Here's Apple's take\non the exact same dialogue box. (Applause) Thank you -- yes, I designed\nthe dialogue box. No, no. Already, we can see\nthat Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent\napproach to software design. Microsoft's approach\nto simplicity tends to be: let's break it down;\nlet's just make it more steps. There are these \"wizards\" everywhere. And you know, there's a new version\nof Windows coming out this fall. If they continue at this pace,\nthere's absolutely no telling where they might wind up. [Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard] (Laughter) (Applause) \"Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard.\" Ok, I'll bite. Let's click \"Next\" to continue. (Laughter) (Applause) From the drop-down menu, choose\nthe first letter you want to type. Ok. (Laughter) So there is a limit\nthat we don't want to cross. So what is the answer? How do you pack in all these features\nin a simple, intelligent way? I believe in consistency, when possible, real-world equivalents, trash can folder, when possible,\nlabel things, mostly. But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules\nif they violate the biggest rule of all, which is intelligence. Now what do I mean by that? I'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something\nnot consistent, but it's better. If you are buying something on the web, you're supposed to put in your address, and you're supposed to choose\nwhat country you're from, ok? There are 200 countries in the world. We like to think of the Internet\nas a global village. I'm sorry; it's not one yet. It's mainly like, the United States,\nEurope, and Japan. So why is \"United States\" in the \"U\"s? (Laughter) You have to scroll, like,\nseven screensful to get to it. Now, it would be inconsistent\nto put \"United States\" first, but it would be intelligent. This one's been touched on before, but why in God's name do you\nshut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called \"Start?\" (Laughter) Here's another pet one of mine:\nyou have a printer. Most of the time, you want to print\none copy of your document, in page order, on that printer. So why in God's name do you see\nthis every time you print? It's like a 747 shuttle cockpit. (Laughter) And one of the buttons at the bottom,\nyou'll notice, is not \"Print.\" (Laughter) (Applause) Now, I'm not saying that Apple\nis the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity. Palm is also, especially in the old days,\nwonderful about this. I actually got to speak to Palm\nwhen they were flying high in the '90s, and after the talk,\nI met one of the employees. He says, \"Nice talk.\" And I said,\n\"Thank you. What do you do here?\" He said, \"I'm a tap counter.\"\nI'm like, \"You're a what?\" He goes, \"Well Jeff Hawkins,\nthe CEO, says, 'If any task on the Palm Pilot\ntakes more than three taps of the stylus, it's too long,\nand it has to be redesigned.' So I'm the tap counter.\" So, I'm going to show you an example of a company that does not\nhave a tap counter. (Laughter) This is Microsoft Word. Ok, when you want to create\na new blank document in Word -- it could happen. (Laughter) You go up to the \"File\" menu\nand you choose \"New.\" Now, what happens when you choose \"New?\" Do you get a new blank document? You do not. On the opposite side of the monitor,\na task bar appears, and somewhere in those links --\nby the way, not at the top -- somewhere in those links is a button\nthat makes you a new document. Ok, so that is a company\nnot counting taps. You know, I don't want to just stand\nhere and make fun of Microsoft ... Yes, I do. (Laughter) (Applause) The Bill Gates song! (Piano music) I've been a geek forever and I wrote the very first DOS. I put my software and IBM together; I got profit and they got the loss. (Laughter) I write the code\nthat makes the whole world run. I'm getting royalties from everyone. Sometimes it's garbage,\nbut the press is snowed. You buy the box; I'll sell the code. Every software company\nis doing Microsoft's R&amp;D. You can't keep a good idea\ndown these days. Even Windows is a hack. We're kind of based loosely on the Mac. So it's big, so it's slow.\nYou've got nowhere to go. I'm not doing this for praise. I write the code\nthat fits the world today. Big mediocrity in every way. We've entered planet domination mode. You'll have no choice; you'll buy my code. I am Bill Gates and I write the code. (Applause) But actually, I believe\nthere are really two Microsofts. There's the old one, responsible\nfor Windows and Office. They're dying to throw the whole thing\nout and start fresh, but they can't. They're locked in, because so many add-ons\nand other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis. But there's also a new Microsoft, that's really doing good,\nsimple interface designs. I liked the Media Center PC. I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch. The Wireless Watch\nflopped miserably in the market, but it wasn't because it wasn't\nsimply and beautifully designed. But let's put it this way: would you pay $10 a month to have a watch that has to be recharged\nevery night like your cell phone, and stops working\nwhen you leave your area code? (Laughter) So, the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch\nis only going to get worse. So is there any hope? The screens are getting smaller,\npeople are illuminating, putting manuals in the boxes, things are coming out at a faster pace. It's funny -- when Steve Jobs\ncame back to Apple in 1997, after 12 years away,\nit was the MacWorld Expo -- he came to the stage\nin that black turtleneck and jeans, and he sort of did this. The crowd went wild,\nbut I had just seen -- I'm like, where have I seen this before? I had just seen the movie \"Evita\" -- (Laughter) with Madonna, and I'm like, you know what? I've got to do one about Steve Jobs. (Music) It won't be easy.\nYou'll think I'm strange. (Laughter) When I try to explain why I'm back, after telling the press\nApple's future is black. You won't believe me. All that you see is a kid in his teens\nwho started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz. (Laughter) You try rhyming with garage! (Laughter) Don't cry for me, Cupertino. (Laughter) The truth is, I never left you. I know the ropes now,\nknow what the tricks are. I made a fortune over at Pixar. (Laughter) Don't cry for me, Cupertino. I've still got the drive and vision. I still wear sandals in any weather. It's just that these days, they're Gucci leather. (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. So Steve Jobs had always believed\nin simplicity and elegance and beauty. And the truth is, for years I was a little depressed, because Americans\nobviously did not value it, because the Mac had\nthree percent market share, Windows had 95 percent market share -- people did not think it was worth\nputting a price on it. So I was a little depressed. And then I heard Al Gore's talk, and I realized I didn't know\nthe meaning of depressed. (Laughter) But it turns out I was wrong, right? Because the iPod came out, and it violated every bit\nof common wisdom. Other products cost less;\nother products had more features, they had voice recorders\nand FM transmitters. The other products were backed\nby Microsoft, with an open standard, not Apple's propriety standard. But the iPod won --\nthis is the one they wanted. The lesson was: simplicity sells. And there are signs that the industry\nis getting the message. This is a little company that's done\nvery well with simplicity and elegance. The Sonos thing -- it's catching on. I've got just a couple examples. Physically, a really cool,\nelegant thinking coming along lately. When you have a digital camera, how do you get the pictures\nback to your computer? Well, you either haul around a USB cable, or you buy a card reader\nand haul that around. Either one, you're going to lose. What I do is, I take out the memory card, and I fold it in half,\nrevealing USB contacts. I just stick it in the computer,\noffload the pictures, put it right back in the camera. I never have to lose anything. Here's another example. Chris, you're the source of all power.\nWill you be my power plug? Chris Anderson: Oh yeah.\nDP: Hold that and don't let go. You might've seen this,\nthis is Apple's new laptop. This the power cord.\nIt hooks on like this. And I'm sure every one of you has done\nthis at some point in your lives, or one of your children. You walk along -- and I'm\nabout to pull this onto the floor. I don't care. It's a loaner. Here we go. Whoa! It's magnetic -- it doesn't pull\nthe laptop onto the floor. (Applause) In my very last example -- I do a lot of my work\nusing speech recognition software. And I'll just --\nyou have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous. Speech recognition\nsoftware is really great for doing emails very quickly; period. Like, I get hundreds of them\na day; period. And it's not just what I dictate\nthat it writes down; period. I also use this feature\ncalled voice macros; period. Correct \"dissuade.\" Not \"just.\" Ok, this is not an ideal situation, because it's getting the echo\nfrom the hall and stuff. The point is, I can respond to people\nvery quickly by saying a short word, and having it write out\na much longer thing. So if somebody\nsends me a fan letter, I'll say, \"Thanks for that.\" [Thank you so much\nfor taking the time to write ...] (Laughter) (Applause) And conversely, if somebody\nsends me hate mail -- which happens daily -- I say, \"Piss off.\" (Laughter) [I admire your frankness ...] (Laughter) (Applause) So that's my dirty little secret.\nDon't tell anyone. (Laughter) So the point is --\nthis is a really interesting story. This is version eight of this software, and do you know what they put\nin version eight? No new features. It's never\nhappened before in software! The company put no new features. They just said, \"We'll make\nthis software work right.\" Right? Because for years, people had bought\nthis software, tried it out -- 95 percent accuracy was all they got, which means one in 20 words is wrong -- and they'd put it in their drawer. And the company got sick of that, so they said, \"This version,\nwe're not going to do anything, but make sure it's darned accurate.\" And so that's what they did. This cult of doing things right\nis starting to spread. So, my final advice for those of you\nwho are consumers of this technology: remember, if it doesn't work,\nit's not necessarily you, ok? It could be the design\nof the thing you're using. Be aware in life\nof good design and bad design. And if you're among the people\nwho create this stuff: Easy is hard. Pre-sweat the details for your audience. Count the taps. Remember, the hard part\nis not deciding what features to add, it's deciding what to leave out. And best of all, your motivation is:\nsimplicity sells. CA: Bravo. DP: Thank you very much. CA: Hear, hear! (Applause)",

I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you\nfor the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night. And I say that sincerely, partly because (Mock sob) I need that. (Laughter) Put yourselves in my position. (Laughter) I flew on Air Force Two for eight years. (Laughter) Now I have to take off my shoes\nor boots to get on an airplane! (Laughter) (Applause) I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what\nthat's been like for me. (Laughter) It's a true story --\nevery bit of this is true. Soon after Tipper and I left the --\n(Mock sob) White House -- (Laughter) we were driving from our home\nin Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville. Driving ourselves. (Laughter) I know it sounds like\na little thing to you, but -- (Laughter) I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. There was no motorcade back there. (Laughter) You've heard of phantom limb pain? (Laughter) This was a rented Ford Taurus. (Laughter) It was dinnertime, and we started looking for a place to eat. We were on I-40. We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee. We got off the exit,\nwe found a Shoney's restaurant. Low-cost family restaurant chain,\nfor those of you who don't know it. We went in and sat down at the booth,\nand the waitress came over, made a big commotion over Tipper. (Laughter) She took our order, and then went\nto the couple in the booth next to us, and she lowered her voice so much, I had to really strain to hear\nwhat she was saying. And she said \"Yes, that's former\nVice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper.\" And the man said, \"He's come down a long way, hasn't he?\" (Laughter) (Applause) There's been kind\nof a series of epiphanies. (Laughter) The very next day,\ncontinuing the totally true story, I got on a G-V to fly to Africa\nto make a speech in Nigeria, in the city of Lagos,\non the topic of energy. And I began the speech\nby telling them the story of what had just happened\nthe day before in Nashville. And I told it pretty much the same way\nI've just shared it with you: Tipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoney's, low-cost\nfamily restaurant chain, what the man said -- they laughed. I gave my speech, then went back\nout to the airport to fly back home. I fell asleep on the plane until, during the middle\nof the night, we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling. I woke up, they opened the door,\nI went out to get some fresh air, and I looked, and there was a man\nrunning across the runway. And he was waving a piece\nof paper, and he was yelling, \"Call Washington! Call Washington!\" And I thought to myself,\nin the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be\nwrong in Washington? Then I remembered\nit could be a bunch of things. (Laughter) But what it turned out to be, was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services\nin Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. It was printed in Monterey, I checked. (Laughter) And the story began, \"Former Vice President Al Gore\nannounced in Nigeria yesterday,\" quote: 'My wife Tipper and I have opened\na low-cost family restaurant'\" -- (Laughter) \"'named Shoney's, and we are running it ourselves.'\" (Laughter) Before I could get back to U.S. soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno\nhad already started in on -- one of them had me\nin a big white chef's hat, Tipper was saying,\n\"One more burger with fries!\" (Laughter) Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner\nand colleague Bill Clinton, saying, \"Congratulations\non the new restaurant, Al!\" (Laughter) We like to celebrate\neach other's successes in life. (Laughter) I was going to talk\nabout information ecology. But I was thinking that, since I plan to make a lifelong habit\nof coming back to TED, that maybe I could talk\nabout that another time. (Applause) Chris Anderson: It's a deal! (Applause) Al Gore: I want to focus\non what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on: What can you do about the climate crisis? I want to start with a couple of -- I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate\njust four or five. Now, the slide show. I update the slide show\nevery time I give it. I add new images, because I learn more about it\nevery time I give it. It's like beach-combing, you know? Every time the tide comes in and out,\nyou find some more shells. Just in the last two days, we got\nthe new temperature records in January. This is just for\nthe United States of America. Historical average\nfor Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees. Now, I know that you wanted some more\nbad news about the environment -- I'm kidding. But these are the recapitulation slides, and then I'm going to go into new\nmaterial about what you can do. But I wanted to elaborate\non a couple of these. First of all, this is where\nwe're projected to go with the U.S. contribution\nto global warming, under business as usual. Efficiency in end-use electricity\nand end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation --\nit's not a cost; it's a profit. The sign is wrong. It's not negative; it's positive. These are investments\nthat pay for themselves. But they are also very effective\nin deflecting our path. Cars and trucks -- I talked\nabout that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective. It's an easy, visible target of concern -- and it should be -- but there is more global warming pollution\nthat comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest\nstandards in the world. And so we should address that.\nBut it's part of the puzzle. Other transportation efficiency\nis as important as cars and trucks. Renewables at the current levels\nof technological efficiency can make this much difference. And with what Vinod, and John Doerr\nand others, many of you here -- there are a lot of people\ndirectly involved in this -- this wedge is going to grow\nmuch more rapidly than the current projection shows it. Carbon Capture and Sequestration --\nthat's what CCS stands for -- is likely to become the killer app\nthat will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels\nin a way that is safe. Not quite there yet. OK. Now, what can you do? Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures\nare also profitable. Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid. Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options\nthat are much better. It's important. Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect\non the global climate crisis. Consider this: Make a decision to live\na carbon-neutral life. Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way\nthat connects with the most people. It is easier than you think. It really is. A lot of us in here\nhave made that decision, and it is really pretty easy. It means reduce\nyour carbon dioxide emissions with the full range\nof choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not\ncompletely reduced. And what it means is elaborated\nat climatecrisis.net. There is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened -- with my active involvement -- the leading software writers in the world, on this arcane science\nof carbon calculation, to construct a consumer-friendly\ncarbon calculator. You can very precisely calculate\nwhat your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given\noptions to reduce. And by the time the movie\ncomes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click-through\npurchases of offsets. Next, consider making\nyour business carbon-neutral. Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions\ninto all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design\nand architecture community. Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this. Listen, if you have invested money\nwith managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don't ever again complain\nabout quarterly report CEO management. Over time, people do\nwhat you pay them to do. And if they judge how much\nthey're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested, based on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisions. A lot more to be said about that. Become a catalyst of change. Teach others, learn about it,\ntalk about it. The movie is a movie version\nof the slideshow I gave two nights ago,\nexcept it's a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May. Many of you here have the opportunity\nto ensure that a lot of people see it. Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well. And I am personally going to train people\nto give this slideshow -- re-purposed, with some\nof the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides,\nit's what they mean. And it's how they link together. And so I'm going to be conducting\na course this summer for a group of people that are\nnominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow\nfor all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge. Working with Larry Lessig, it will be,\nsomewhere in that process, posted with tools\nand limited-use copyrights, so that young people can remix it\nand do it in their own way. (Applause) Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay\narm's length from politics? It doesn't mean\nthat if you're a Republican, that I'm trying to convince you\nto be a Democrat. We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that\nin this group it really is. Become politically active. Make our democracy work the way\nit's supposed to work. Support the idea of capping\ncarbon dioxide emissions -- global warming pollution --\nand trading it. Here's why: as long as the United States\nis out of the world system, it's not a closed system. Once it becomes a closed system,\nwith U.S. participation, then everybody\nwho's on a board of directors -- how many people here\nserve on the board of directors of a corporation? Once it's a closed system, you will have legal liability\nif you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing\nand trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. The market will work\nto solve this problem -- if we can accomplish this. Help with the mass persuasion campaign\nthat will start this spring. We have to change the minds\nof the American people. Because presently, the politicians\ndo not have permission to do what needs to be done. And in our modern country, the role\nof logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power\nthe way it once did. It's now repetition of short, hot-button,\n30-second, 28-second television ads. We have to buy a lot of those ads. Let's re-brand global warming,\nas many of you have suggested. I like \"climate crisis\"\ninstead of \"climate collapse,\" but again, those of you\nwho are good at branding, I need your help on this. Somebody said the test\nwe're facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination\nof an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination. (Laughter) That's really true. I said the other night,\nand I'll repeat now: this is not a political issue. Again, the Republicans here --\nthis shouldn't be partisan. You have more influence\nthan some of us who are Democrats do. This is an opportunity. Not just this, but connected\nto the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them. We are one. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. (Applause)",

        "transcript": "About 10 years ago, I took on the task\nto teach global development to Swedish undergraduate students. That was after having spent\nabout 20 years, together with African institutions, studying hunger in Africa. So I was sort of expected\nto know a little about the world. And I started, in our medical university,\nKarolinska Institute, an undergraduate course\ncalled Global Health. But when you get that opportunity,\nyou get a little nervous. I thought, these students coming to us\nactually have the highest grade you can get in the Swedish college system, so I thought, maybe they know everything\nI'm going to teach them about. So I did a pretest when they came. And one of the questions\nfrom which I learned a lot was this one: \"Which country has the highest\nchild mortality of these five pairs?\" And I put them together\nso that in each pair of countries, one has twice the child\nmortality of the other. And this means that\nit's much bigger, the difference, than the uncertainty of the data. I won't put you at a test here,\nbut it's Turkey, which is highest there, Poland,\nRussia, Pakistan and South Africa. And these were the results\nof the Swedish students. I did it so I got the confidence interval,\nwhich is pretty narrow. And I got happy, of course -- a 1.8\nright answer out of five possible. That means there was a place\nfor a professor of international health and for my course. (Laughter) But one late night,\nwhen I was compiling the report, I really realized my discovery. I have shown that Swedish top students\nknow, statistically, significantly less about the world\nthan the chimpanzees. (Laughter) Because the chimpanzee\nwould score half right if I gave them two bananas\nwith Sri Lanka and Turkey. They would be right half of the cases.\nBut the students are not there. The problem for me was not ignorance;\nit was preconceived ideas. I did also an unethical study of the professors\nof the Karolinska Institute, which hands out\nthe Nobel Prize in Medicine, and they are on par\nwith the chimpanzee there. (Laughter) This is where I realized that\nthere was really a need to communicate, because the data\nof what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware. So we did this software,\nwhich displays it like this. Every bubble here is a country. This country over here is China. This is India. The size of the bubble is the population, and on this axis here,\nI put fertility rate. Because my students, what they said when they looked upon the world,\nand I asked them, \"What do you really\nthink about the world?\" Well, I first discovered\nthat the textbook was Tintin, mainly. (Laughter) And they said, \"The world\nis still 'we' and 'them.' And 'we' is the Western world\nand 'them' is the Third World.\" \"And what do you mean\nwith 'Western world?'\" I said. \"Well, that's long life and small family. And 'Third World' is short life\nand large family.\" So this is what I could display here. I put fertility rate here -- number of children per woman:\none, two, three, four, up to about eight children per woman. We have very good data\nsince 1962, 1960, about, on the size of families in all countries. The error margin is narrow. Here, I put life expectancy at birth, from 30 years in some countries,\nup to about 70 years. And in 1962, there was really\na group of countries here that were industrialized countries, and they had small families\nand long lives. And these were the developing countries. They had large families\nand they had relatively short lives. Now, what has happened since 1962?\nWe want to see the change. Are the students right?\nIt's still two types of countries? Or have these developing countries\ngot smaller families and they live here? Or have they got longer lives\nand live up there? Let's see. We stopped the world then. This is all UN statistics\nthat have been available. Here we go. Can you see there? It's China there, moving against\nbetter health there, improving there. All the green Latin American countries\nare moving towards smaller families. Your yellow ones here\nare the Arabic countries, and they get longer life,\nbut not larger families. The Africans are the green here.\nThey still remain here. This is India; Indonesia\nis moving on pretty fast. In the '80s here, you have Bangladesh\nstill among the African countries. But now, Bangladesh -- it's a miracle\nthat happens in the '80s -- the imams start to promote\nfamily planning, and they move up into that corner. And in the '90s, we have\nthe terrible HIV epidemic that takes down the life expectancy\nof the African countries. And the rest of them all\nmove up into the corner, where we have long lives and small family, and we have a completely new world. (Applause) (Applause ends) Let me make a comparison directly between the United States\nof America and Vietnam. 1964: America had small families and long life; Vietnam had large families\nand short lives. And this is what happens. The data during the war indicate\nthat even with all the death, there was an improvement\nof life expectancy. By the end of the year,\nfamily planning started in Vietnam, and they went for smaller families. And the United States up there\nis getting longer life, keeping family size. And in the '80s now,\nthey give up Communist planning and they go for market economy, and it moves faster even than social life. And today, we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy\nand the same family size here in Vietnam, 2003, as in United States, 1974,\nby the end of the war. I think we all, if we don't\nlook at the data, we underestimate\nthe tremendous change in Asia, which was in social change\nbefore we saw the economic change. So let's move over to another way here in which we could display\nthe distribution in the world of income. This is the world distribution\nof income of people. One dollar, 10 dollars\nor 100 dollars per day. There's no gap between rich\nand poor any longer. This is a myth. There's a little hump here. But there are people all the way. And if we look where the income ends up, this is 100 percent\nof the world's annual income. And the richest 20 percent, they take out of that about 74 percent. And the poorest 20 percent,\nthey take about two percent. And this shows that the concept\nof developing countries is extremely doubtful. We think about aid, like these people here giving aid\nto these people here. But in the middle, we have\nmost of the world population, and they have now\n24 percent of the income. We heard it in other forms. And who are these? Where are the different countries? I can show you Africa. This is Africa. Ten percent of the world population, most in poverty. This is OECD -- the rich countries,\nthe country club of the UN. And they are over here on this side.\nQuite an overlap between Africa and OECD. And this is Latin America. It has everything on this earth,\nfrom the poorest to the richest in Latin America. And on top of that,\nwe can put East Europe, we can put East Asia,\nand we put South Asia. And what did it look like\nif we go back in time, to about 1970? Then, there was more of a hump. And most who lived\nin absolute poverty were Asians. The problem in the world\nwas the poverty in Asia. And if I now let the world move forward, you will see that\nwhile population increases, there are hundreds of millions\nin Asia getting out of poverty, and some others getting into poverty, and this is the pattern we have today. And the best projection\nfrom the World Bank is that this will happen, and we will not have a divided world. We'll have most people in the middle. Of course it's a logarithmic scale here, but our concept of economy\nis growth with percent. We look upon it as a possibility\nof percentile increase. If I change this and take GDP per capita\ninstead of family income, and I turn these individual data into regional data\nof gross domestic product, and I take the regions down here, the size of the bubble\nis still the population. And you have the OECD there,\nand you have sub-Saharan Africa there, and we take off the Arab states there, coming both from Africa and from Asia, and we put them separately, and we can expand this axis,\nand I can give it a new dimension here, by adding the social values\nthere, child survival. Now I have money on that axis, and I have the possibility\nof children to survive there. In some countries, 99.7% of children\nsurvive to five years of age; others, only 70. And here, it seems,\nthere is a gap between OECD, Latin America, East Europe, East Asia, Arab states, South Asia\nand sub-Saharan Africa. The linearity is very strong\nbetween child survival and money. But let me split sub-Saharan Africa. Health is there\nand better health is up there. I can go here, and I can split\nsub-Saharan Africa into its countries. And when it bursts, the size of each country bubble\nis the size of the population. Sierra Leone down there,\nMauritius is up there. Mauritius was the first country\nto get away with trade barriers, and they could sell their sugar,\nthey could sell their textiles, on equal terms as the people\nin Europe and North America. There's a huge difference [within] Africa. And Ghana is here in the middle. In Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid. Here in Uganda, development aid. Here, time to invest;\nthere, you can go for a holiday. There's tremendous variation\nwithin Africa, which we very often make\nthat it's equal everything. I can split South Asia here.\nIndia's the big bubble in the middle. But there's a huge difference\nbetween Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. I can split Arab states. How are they? Same climate, same culture,\nsame religion -- huge difference. Even between neighbors -- Yemen, civil war; United Arab Emirates, money,\nwhich was quite equally and well-used. Not as the myth is. And that includes all the children\nof the foreign workers who are in the country. Data is often better than you think.\nMany people say data is bad. There is an uncertainty margin,\nbut we can see the difference here: Cambodia, Singapore. The differences are much bigger\nthan the weakness of the data. East Europe: Soviet economy\nfor a long time, but they come out after 10 years\nvery, very differently. And there is Latin America. Today, we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country\nin Latin America. Chile will have a lower child mortality\nthan Cuba within some few years from now. Here, we have high-income\ncountries in the OECD. And we get the whole pattern\nhere of the world, which is more or less like this. And if we look at it, how the world looks, in 1960, it starts to move. This is Mao Zedong.\nHe brought health to China. And then he died. And then Deng Xiaoping came\nand brought money to China, and brought them\ninto the mainstream again. And we have seen how countries\nmove in different directions like this, so it's sort of difficult to get\nan example country which shows the pattern of the world. But I would like to bring you back\nto about here, at 1960. I would like to compare\nSouth Korea, which is this one, with Brazil, which is this one. The label went away for me here. And I would like to compare\nUganda, which is there. I can run it forward, like this. And you can see how South Korea is making\na very, very fast advancement, whereas Brazil is much slower. And if we move back again, here,\nand we put trails on them, like this, you can see again that the speed of development\nis very, very different, and the countries are moving\nmore or less at the same rate as money and health, but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first\nthan if you are wealthy first. And to show that, you can put\non the way of United Arab Emirates. They came from here, a mineral country. They cached all the oil;\nthey got all the money; but health cannot be bought\nat the supermarket. You have to invest in health.\nYou have to get kids into schooling. You have to train health staff.\nYou have to educate the population. And Sheikh Zayed did that\nin a fairly good way. In spite of falling oil prices,\nhe brought this country up here. So we've got a much more mainstream\nappearance of the world, where all countries tend\nto use their money better than they used it in the past. Now, this is, more or less, if you look\nat the average data of the countries -- they are like this. That's dangerous, to use average data, because there is such\na lot of difference within countries. So if I go and look here, we can see that Uganda today\nis where South Korea was in 1960. If I split Uganda, there's quite\na difference within Uganda. These are the quintiles of Uganda. The richest 20 percent\nof Ugandans are there. The poorest are down there. If I split South Africa, it's like this. And if I go down and look at Niger, where there was such\na terrible famine [recently], it's like this. The 20 percent poorest\nof Niger is out here, and the 20 percent richest\nof South Africa is there, and yet we tend to discuss\nwhat solutions there should be in Africa. Everything in this world exists in Africa. And you can't discuss\nuniversal access to HIV [treatment] for that quintile up here with the same strategy as down here. The improvement of the world\nmust be highly contextualized, and it's not relevant to have it\non a regional level. We must be much more detailed. We find that students get very excited\nwhen they can use this. And even more, policy makers\nand the corporate sectors would like to see\nhow the world is changing. Now, why doesn't this take place? Why are we not using the data we have? We have data in the United Nations,\nin the national statistical agencies and in universities and other\nnongovernmental organizations. Because the data is hidden\ndown in the databases. And the public is there,\nand the internet is there, but we have still not used it effectively. All that information\nwe saw changing in the world does not include\npublicly funded statistics. There are some web pages\nlike this, you know, but they take some nourishment\ndown from the databases, but people put prices on them,\nstupid passwords and boring statistics. (Laughter) And this won't work. (Applause) So what is needed? We have the databases. It's not a new database that you need. We have wonderful design tools\nand more and more are added up here. So we started a nonprofit venture\nlinking data to design, we called \"Gapminder,\" from the London Underground,\nwhere they warn you, \"Mind the gap.\" So we thought Gapminder was appropriate. And we started to write software\nwhich could link the data like this. And it wasn't that difficult. It took some person years,\nand we have produced animations. You can take a data set and put it there. We are liberating UN data,\nsome few UN organization. Some countries accept that\ntheir databases can go out on the world. But what we really need is,\nof course, a search function, a search function where we can copy\nthe data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world. And what do we hear when we go around? I've done anthropology\non the main statistical units. Everyone says, \"It's impossible.\nThis can't be done. Our information is so peculiar in detail, so that cannot be searched\nas others can be searched. We cannot give the data\nfree to the students, free to the entrepreneurs of the world.\" But this is what we would\nlike to see, isn't it? The publicly funded data is down here. And we would like flowers\nto grow out on the net. One of the crucial points\nis to make them searchable, and then people can use the different\ndesign tools to animate it there. And I have pretty good news for you. I have good news that the [current], new head of UN statistics\ndoesn't say it's impossible. He only says, \"We can't do it.\" (Laughter) And that's a quite clever guy, huh? (Laughter) So we can see a lot happening\nin data in the coming years. We will be able to look at income\ndistributions in completely new ways. This is the income distribution\nof China, 1970. This is the income distribution\nof the United States, 1970. Almost no overlap. Almost no overlap. And what has happened? What has happened is this: that China is growing,\nit's not so equal any longer, and it's appearing here,\noverlooking the United States, almost like a ghost, isn't it? (Laughter) It's pretty scary. (Laughter) But I think it's very important\nto have all this information. We need really to see it. And instead of looking at this, I would like to end up by showing\nthe internet users per 1,000. In this software, we access\nabout 500 variables from all the countries quite easily. It takes some time to change for this, but on the axes, you can quite easily\nget any variable you would like to have. And the thing would be\nto get up the databases free, to get them searchable,\nand with a second click, to get them into the graphic formats,\nwhere you can instantly understand them. Now, statisticians don't like it,\nbecause they say that this will not show the reality; we have to have statistical,\nanalytical methods. But this is hypothesis-generating. I end now with the world. There, the internet is coming. The number of internet users\nare going up like this. This is the GDP per capita. And it's a new technology coming in,\nbut then amazingly, how well it fits to the economy\nof the countries. That's why the $100 computer\nwill be so important. But it's a nice tendency. It's as if the world\nis flattening off, isn't it? These countries are lifting more\nthan the economy, and it will be very interesting\nto follow this over the year, as I would like you to be able to do\nwith all the publicly funded data. Thank you very much. (Applause)",

        "transcript": "Thank you. I have to tell you\nI'm both challenged and excited. My excitement is: I get a chance\nto give something back. My challenge is: the shortest seminar\nI usually do is 50 hours. (Laughter) I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends -- I do more, obviously,\nI also coach people -- but I'm into immersion,\nbecause how did you learn language? Not just by learning principles, you got in it and you did it\nso often that it became real. The bottom line of why I'm here,\nbesides being a crazy mofo, is that -- I'm not here to motivate you,\nyou don't need that, obviously. Often that's what people think I do, and it's the furthest thing from it. What happens, though, is people say to me, \"I don't need any motivation.\" But that's not what I do. I'm the \"why\" guy. I want to know why you do what you do. What is your motive for action? What is it that drives you\nin your life today? Not 10 years ago. Are you running the same pattern? Because I believe that the invisible force\nof internal drive, activated, is the most important thing. I'm here because I believe\nemotion is the force of life. All of us here have great minds. Most of us here have great minds, right? We all know how to think. With our minds we can\nrationalize anything. We can make anything happen. I agree with what was described\na few days ago, that people work in their self-interest. But we know that that's bullshit at times. You don't work in your\nself-interest all the time, because when emotion comes into it, the wiring changes\nin the way it functions. So it's wonderful to think intellectually\nabout how the life of the world is, especially those who are very smart\ncan play this game in our head. But I really want to know\nwhat's driving you. What I would like to invite you to do by the end of this talk is explore\nwhere you are today, for two reasons. One: so that you can contribute more. And two: that hopefully we can not just\nunderstand other people more, but appreciate them more,\nand create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challenges\nthat we face today. They're only going to get magnified\nby the very technology that connects us, because it's making us intersect. That intersection\ndoesn't always create a view of \"everybody now understands everybody, and everybody appreciates everybody.\" I've had an obsession\nbasically for 30 years, \"What makes the difference\nin the quality of people's lives? What in their performance?\" I got hired to produce the result now. I've done it for 30 years. I get the phone call when the athlete is burning down\non national television, and they were ahead by five strokes and now they can't get back on the course. I've got to do something right now\nor nothing matters. I get the phone call when the child\nis going to commit suicide, I've got to do something. In 29 years, I'm very grateful\nto tell you I've never lost one. It doesn't mean I won't some day,\nbut I haven't yet. The reason is an understanding\nof these human needs. When I get those calls\nabout performance, that's one thing. How do you make a change? I'm also looking to see what is shaping\nthe person's ability to contribute, to do something beyond themselves. Maybe the real question is, I look at life and say\nthere's two master lessons. One is: there's the science\nof achievement, which almost everyone here\nhas mastered amazingly. \"How do you take the invisible\nand make it visible,\" How do you make your dreams happen? Your business, your contribution\nto society, money -- whatever, your body, your family. The other lesson that is rarely\nmastered is the art of fulfillment. Because science is easy, right? We know the rules, you write the code\nand you get the results. Once you know the game,\nyou just up the ante, don't you? But when it comes\nto fulfillment -- that's an art. The reason is, it's about\nappreciation and contribution. You can only feel so much by yourself. I've had an interesting laboratory\nto try to answer the real question how somebody's life changes if you look at them like those people\nthat you've given everything to? Like all the resources they say they need. You gave not a 100-dollar computer,\nbut the best computer. You gave them love, joy,\nwere there to comfort them. Those people very often --\nyou know some of them -- end up the rest of their life with all this love, education,\nmoney and background going in and out of rehab. Some people have been\nthrough ultimate pain, psychologically, sexually,\nspiritually, emotionally abused -- and not always, but often, they become some of the people\nthat contribute the most to society. The question we've got to ask\nourselves really is, what is it? What is it that shapes us? We live in a therapy culture. Most of us don't do that,\nbut the culture's a therapy culture, the mindset that we are our past. And you wouldn't be in this room\nif you bought that, but most of society\nthinks biography is destiny. The past equals the future. Of course it does if you live there. But what we know and what\nwe have to remind ourselves -- because you can know\nsomething intellectually and then not use it, not apply it. We've got to remind ourselves\nthat decision is the ultimate power. When you ask people, have you failed to achieve\nsomething significant in your life? Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye. TR: Thanks for the interaction\non a high level there. But if you ask people,\nwhy didn't you achieve something? Somebody who's working for you,\nor a partner, or even yourself. When you fail to achieve,\nwhat's the reason people say? What do they tell you? Didn't have the knowledge,\ndidn't have the money, didn't have the time,\ndidn't have the technology. I didn't have the right manager. Al Gore: Supreme Court.\nTR: The Supreme Court. (Laughter) (Applause) (Cheering) (Applause continues) TR: And -- (Applause) What do all those, including\nthe Supreme Court, have in common? (Laughter) They are a claim to you missing\nresources, and they may be accurate. You may not have the money,\nor the Supreme Court, but that is not the defining factor. (Applause) (Laughter) And you correct me if I'm wrong. The defining factor is never resources;\nit's resourcefulness. And what I mean specifically,\nrather than just some phrase, is if you have emotion, human emotion, something that I experienced from you\nthe day before yesterday at a level that is as profound\nas I've ever experienced and I believe with that emotion\nyou would have beat his ass and won. Audience: Yeah! (Applause) (Cheering) How easy for me to tell him\nwhat he should do. (Laughter) Idiot, Robbins. But I know when we watched\nthe debate at that time, there were emotions\nthat blocked people's ability to get this man's intellect and capacity. And the way that it came across\nto some people on that day -- because I know people that wanted\nto vote in your direction and didn't, and I was upset. But there was emotion there. Do you know what I'm talking about? Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye. TR: So, emotion is it. And if we get the right emotion,\nwe can get ourselves to do anything. If you're creative, playful, fun enough, can you get through to anybody, yes or no? If you don't have the money, but you're creative and determined,\nyou find the way. This is the ultimate resource. But this is not the story\nthat people tell us. They tell us a bunch of different stories. They tell us we don't have\nthe resources, but ultimately, if you take a look here, they say, what are all the reasons\nthey haven't accomplished that? He's broken my pattern,\nthat son-of-a-bitch. (Laughter) But I appreciated the energy,\nI'll tell you that. (Laughter) What determines your resources? We've said decisions shape destiny,\nwhich is my focus here. If decisions shape destiny,\nwhat determines it is three decisions. What will you focus on? You have to decide\nwhat you're going to focus on. Consciously or unconsciously. the minute you decide to focus,\nyou must give it a meaning, and that meaning produces emotion. Is this the end or the beginning? Is God punishing me or rewarding me,\nor is this the roll of the dice? An emotion creates\nwhat we're going to do, or the action. So, think about your own life, the decisions that\nhave shaped your destiny. And that sounds really heavy,\nbut in the last five or 10 years, have there been some decisions that if you'd made a different decision,\nyour life would be completely different? How many can think about it?\nBetter or worse. Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye. So the bottom line is,\nmaybe it was where to go to work, and you met the love of your life there,\na career decision. I know the Google geniuses I saw here -- I mean, I understand that their decision\nwas to sell their technology. What if they made that decision\nversus to build their own culture? How would the world or their lives\nbe different, their impact? The history of our world\nis these decisions. When a woman stands up and says,\n\"No, I won't go to the back of the bus.\" She didn't just affect her life.\nThat decision shaped our culture. Or someone standing in front of a tank. Or being in a position\nlike Lance Armstrong, \"You've got testicular cancer.\" That's pretty tough for any male,\nespecially if you ride a bike. (Laughter) You've got it in your brain;\nyou've got it in your lungs. But what was his decision\nof what to focus on? Different than most people.\nWhat did it mean? It wasn't the end; it was the beginning. He goes off and wins\nseven championships he never once won before the cancer, because he got\nemotional fitness, psychological strength. That's the difference\nin human beings that I've seen of the three million I've been around. In my lab, I've had three million people\nfrom 80 countries over the last 29 years. And after a while,\npatterns become obvious. You see that South America and Africa\nmay be connected in a certain way, right? Others say, \"Oh, that sounds\nridiculous.\" It's simple. So, what shaped Lance? What shapes you? Two invisible forces.\nVery quickly. One: state. We all have had times, you did something, and after,\nyou thought to yourself, \"I can't believe I said or did that,\nthat was so stupid.\" Who's been there? Say, \"Aye.\"\nAudience: Aye. Or after you did something,\nyou go, \"That was me!\" (Laughter) It wasn't your ability; it was your state. Your model of the world\nis what shapes you long term. Your model of the world is the filter.\nThat's what's shaping us. It makes people make decisions. To influence somebody, we need to know\nwhat already influences them. It's made up of three parts. First, what's your target?\nWhat are you after? It's not your desires. You can get your desires or goals. Who has ever got a goal or desire\nand thought, is this all there is? Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye. It's needs we have. I believe\nthere are six human needs. Second, once you know what the target\nthat's driving you is and you uncover it for the truth --\nyou don't form it -- then you find out what's your map, what's the belief systems\nthat tell you how to get those needs. Some people think the way\nto get them is to destroy the world, some people, to build,\ncreate something, love someone. There's the fuel you pick.\nSo very quickly, six needs. Let me tell you what they are.\nFirst one: certainty. These are not goals or desires,\nthese are universal. Everyone needs certainty\nthey can avoid pain and at least be comfortable. Now, how do you get it? Control everybody? Develop a skill?\nGive up? Smoke a cigarette? And if you got totally\ncertain, ironically, even though we need that -- you're not certain about your health,\nor your children, or money. If you're not sure\nthe ceiling will hold up, you won't listen to any speaker. While we go for certainty differently,\nif we get total certainty, we get what? What do you feel if you're certain? You know what will happen,\nwhen and how it will happen, what would you feel? Bored out of your minds.\nSo, God, in Her infinite wisdom, gave us a second human need,\nwhich is uncertainty. We need variety. We need surprise. How many of you here\nlove surprises? Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye. TR: Bullshit. You like\nthe surprises you want. The ones you don't want,\nyou call problems, but you need them. So, variety is important. Have you ever rented a video\nor a film that you've already seen? Who's done this? Get a fucking life. (Laughter) Why are you doing it? You're certain it's good\nbecause you read or saw it before, but you're hoping it's been\nlong enough you've forgotten, and there's variety. Third human need, critical: significance. We all need to feel important,\nspecial, unique. You can get it by making more money\nor being more spiritual. You can do it by getting yourself\nin a situation where you put more tattoos and earrings in places\nhumans don't want to know. Whatever it takes. The fastest way to do this, if you have no background,\nno culture, no belief and resources or resourcefulness, is violence. If I put a gun to your head and I live\nin the 'hood, instantly I'm significant. Zero to 10. How high? 10. How certain am I that\nyou're going to respond to me? 10. How much uncertainty? Who knows what's going to happen next?\nKind of exciting. Like climbing up into a cave\nand doing that stuff all the way down there. Total variety and uncertainty. And it's significant, isn't it?\nSo you want to risk your life for it. So that's why violence has always\nbeen around and will be around unless we have a consciousness\nchange as a species. You can get significance a million ways, but to be significant, you've got\nto be unique and different. Here's what we really need:\nconnection and love, fourth need. We all want it; most settle for connection,\nlove's too scary. Who here has been hurt\nin an intimate relationship? If you don't raise your hand,\nyou've had other shit, too. And you're going to get hurt again. Aren't you glad you came\nto this positive visit? Here's what's true: we need it. We can do it through\nintimacy, friendship, prayer, through walking in nature. If nothing else works for you,\ndon't get a cat, get a dog, because if you leave for two minutes,\nit's like you've been gone six months, when you come back 5 minutes later. These first four needs,\nevery human finds a way to meet. Even if you lie to yourself,\nyou need to have split personalities. I call the first four needs\nthe needs of the personality. The last two are the needs of the spirit. And this is where fulfillment comes. You won't get it from the first four. You'll figure a way, smoke, drink,\ndo whatever, meet the first four. But number five, you must grow. We all know the answer. If you don't grow, you're what? If a relationship or business\nis not growing, if you're not growing, doesn't matter how much\nmoney or friends you have, how many love you, you feel like hell. And I believe the reason we grow is so we have something to give of value. Because the sixth need\nis to contribute beyond ourselves. Because we all know, corny as that sounds, the secret to living is giving. We all know life is not about me,\nit's about we. This culture knows that,\nthis room knows that. It's exciting. When you see Nicholas\ntalking about his $100 computer, the most exciting thing is: here's a genius,\nbut he's got a calling now. You can feel the difference in him,\nand it's beautiful. And that calling can touch other people. My life was touched\nbecause when I was 11 years old, Thanksgiving, no money, no food, we were not going to starve, but my father was totally messed up, my mom was letting him know\nhow bad he messed up, and somebody came to the door\nand delivered food. My father made three decisions,\nI know what they were, briefly. His focus was \"This is charity. What does it mean? I'm worthless. What do I have to do?\nLeave my family,\" which he did. It was one of the most painful\nexperiences of life. My three decisions\ngave me a different path. I set focus on \"There's food.\"\nWhat a concept! (Laughter) But this is what changed my life,\nshaped me as a human being. Somebody's gift,\nI don't even know who it is. My father always said,\n\"No one gives a shit.\" And now somebody I don't know, they're not asking for anything,\njust giving us food, looking out for us. It made me believe this:\nthat strangers care. And that made me decide, if strangers care about me and my family,\nI care about them. I'm going to do something\nto make a difference. So when I was 17,\nI went out on Thanksgiving, it was my target for years to have\nenough money to feed two families. The most fun and moving thing\nI ever did in my life. Next year, I did four, then eight. I didn't tell anybody what I was doing,\nI wasn't doing it for brownie points. But after eight,\nI thought I could use some help. So I went out, got my friends involved, then I grew companies, got 11,\nand I built the foundation. 18 years later, I'm proud to tell you last year we fed\n2 million people in 35 countries through our foundation. All during the holidays,\nThanksgiving, Christmas, in different countries around the world. (Applause) Thank you. I don't tell you that to brag,\nbut because I'm proud of human beings because they get excited to contribute once they've had the chance\nto experience it, not talk about it. So, finally -- I'm about out of time. The target that shapes you -- Here's what's different about people. We have the same needs. But are you a certainty freak,\nis that what you value most, or uncertainty? This man couldn't be a certainty freak\nif he climbed through those caves. Are you driven by significance or love? We all need all six, but what your lead system is\ntilts you in a different direction. And as you move in a direction,\nyou have a destination or destiny. The second piece is the map. The operating system\ntells you how to get there, and some people's map is, \"I'm going to save lives\neven if I die for other people,\" and they're a fireman, and somebody else says,\n\"I'm going to kill people to do it.\" They're trying to meet\nthe same needs of significance. They want to honor God\nor honor their family. But they have a different map. And there are seven different beliefs;\nI can't go through them, because I'm done. The last piece is emotion. One of the parts of the map is like time. Some people's idea\nof a long time is 100 years. Somebody else's is three seconds,\nwhich is what I have. And the last one I've already mentioned\nthat fell to you. If you've got a target and a map -- I can't use Google because I love Macs, and they haven't made it\ngood for Macs yet. So if you use MapQuest -- how many have made\nthis fatal mistake of using it? You use this thing\nand you don't get there. Imagine if your beliefs guarantee\nyou can never get to where you want to go. (Laughter) The last thing is emotion. Here's what I'll tell you about emotion. There are 6,000 emotions that we have words for\nin the English language, which is just a linguistic representation\nthat changes by language. But if your dominant emotions -- If I have 20,000 people or 1,000 and I have them write down\nall the emotions that they experience in an average week, and I give them as long as they need, and on one side\nthey write empowering emotions, the other's disempowering, guess how many emotions\nthey experience? Less than 12. And half of those\nmake them feel like shit. They have six good feelings. Happy, happy, excited, oh shit, frustrated, frustrated,\noverwhelmed, depressed. How many of you know somebody who, no matter what happens,\nfinds a way to get pissed off? (Laughter) Or no matter what happens,\nthey find a way to be happy or excited. How many of you know somebody like this? When 9/11 happened, I'll finish\nwith this, I was in Hawaii. I was with 2,000 people from 45 countries, we were translating\nfour languages simultaneously for a program I was conducting,\nfor a week. The night before was called\nEmotional Mastery. I got up, had no plan\nfor this, and I said -- we had fireworks,\nI do crazy shit, fun stuff, and at the end, I stopped. I had this plan, but I never know\nwhat I'm going to say. And all of a sudden, I said, \"When do people really start to live?\nWhen they face death.\" And I went through this whole thing about, if you weren't going\nto get off this island, if nine days from now,\nyou were going to die, who would you call,\nwhat would you say, what would you do? That night is when 9/11 happened. One woman had come to the seminar,\nand when she came there, her previous boyfriend had been\nkidnapped and murdered. Her new boyfriend wanted to marry her,\nand she said no. He said, \"If you go to that Hawaii thing,\nit's over with us.\" She said, \"It's over.\" When I finished that night,\nshe called him and left a message at the top of the World Trade Center\nwhere he worked, saying, \"I love you, I want you to know\nI want to marry you. It was stupid of me.\" She was asleep, because it was 3 a.m.\nfor us, when he called her back, and said, \"Honey, I can't tell you\nwhat this means. I don't know how to tell you this,\nbut you gave me the greatest gift, because I'm going to die.\" And she played the recording\nfor us in the room. She was on Larry King later. And he said, \"You're probably wondering how on Earth this could\nhappen to you twice. All I can say is this must be\nGod's message to you. From now on, every day,\ngive your all, love your all. Don't let anything ever stop you.\" She finishes, and a man\nstands up, and he says, \"I'm from Pakistan, I'm a Muslim. I'd love to hold your hand\nand say I'm sorry, but frankly, this is retribution.\" I can't tell you the rest,\nbecause I'm out of time. (Laughter) Are you sure? (Laughter) 10 seconds! (Laughter and applause) 10 seconds, I want to be respectful. All I can tell you is, I brought this man on stage with a man from New York who worked\nin the World Trade Center, because I had about 200 New Yorkers there. More than 50 lost\ntheir entire companies, friends, marking off their Palm Pilots. One financial trader,\nwoman made of steel, bawling -- 30 friends crossing off that all died. And I said, \"What are we\ngoing to focus on? What does this mean\nand what are we going to do?\" And I got the group to focus on: if you didn't lose somebody today, your focus is going to be\nhow to serve somebody else. Then one woman stood up\nand was so angry, screaming and yelling. I found out she wasn't from New York,\nshe's not an American, doesn't know anybody here. I asked, \"Do you always get angry?\" She said, \"Yes.\" Guilty people got guilty,\nsad people got sad. I took these two men\nand I did an indirect negotiation. Jewish man with family\nin the occupied territory, someone in New York who would have died\nif he was at work that day, and this man who wanted to be a terrorist, and I made it very clear. This integration is on a film,\nwhich I'd be happy to send you, instead of my verbalization, but the two of them not only came together and changed their beliefs\nand models of the world, but worked together to bring,\nfor almost four years now, through various mosques and synagogues, the idea of how to create peace. And he wrote a book, called\n\"My Jihad, My Way of Peace.\" So, transformation can happen. My invitation to you is: explore your web, the web in here -- the needs, the beliefs, the emotions\nthat are controlling you, for two reasons: so there's more of you to give,\nand achieve, too, but I mean give, because that's what's\ngoing to fill you up. And secondly, so you can appreciate -- not just understand,\nthat's intellectual, that's the mind, but appreciate\nwhat's driving other people. It's the only way\nour world's going to change. God bless you, thank you.\nI hope this was of service. (Applause)",

        "transcript": "On September 10, the morning\nof my seventh birthday, I came downstairs to the kitchen,\nwhere my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading\nthe paper or something, and I sort of presented myself to them\nin the doorway, and they said, \"Hey, happy birthday!\"\nAnd I said, \"I'm seven.\" And my father smiled and said, \"Well, you know\nwhat that means, don't you?\" And I said, \"Yeah,\nthat I'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents?\" And my dad said, \"Well, yes. But more importantly, being seven means that\nyou've reached the age of reason, and you're now capable of committing\nany and all sins against God and man.\" (Laughter) Now, I had heard this phrase,\n\"age of reason,\" before. Sister Mary Kevin\nhad been bandying it about my second-grade class at school. But when she said it, the phrase seemed all caught up\nin the excitement of preparations for our first communion\nand our first confession, and everybody knew that was really\nall about the white dress and the white veil. And anyway, I hadn't really paid\nall that much attention to that phrase, \"age of reason.\" So, I said, \"Yeah, yeah, age of reason.\nWhat does that mean again?\" And my dad said, \"Well, we believe,\nin the Catholic Church, that God knows that little kids don't know\nthe difference between right and wrong, but when you're seven,\nyou're old enough to know better. So, you've grown up\nand reached the age of reason, and now God will start\nkeeping notes on you, and begin your permanent record.\" (Laughter) And I said, \"Oh ... Wait a minute. You mean all that time, up till today, all that time I was so good,\nGod didn't notice it?\" And my mom said, \"Well, I noticed it.\" (Laughter) And I thought, \"How could\nI not have known this before? How could it not have sunk in\nwhen they'd been telling me? All that being good\nand no real credit for it. And worst of all,\nhow could I not have realized this very important information until the very day\nthat it was basically useless to me?\" So I said, \"Well, Mom and Dad,\nwhat about Santa Claus? I mean, Santa Claus knows\nif you're naughty or nice, right?\" And my dad said, \"Yeah, but, honey, I think that's technically just\nbetween Thanksgiving and Christmas.\" And my mother said, \"Oh, Bob, stop it.\nLet's just tell her. I mean, she's seven. Julie, there is no Santa Claus.\" (Laughter) Now, this was actually\nnot that upsetting to me. My parents had this whole\nelaborate story about Santa Claus: how they had talked to Santa Claus\nhimself and agreed that instead of Santa\ndelivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve, like he did for every other family\nwho got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning, our family would give Santa more time. Santa would come to our house\nwhile we were at nine o'clock high mass on Christmas morning, but only\nif all of us kids did not make a fuss. Which made me very suspicious. It was pretty obvious that it was really\nour parents giving us the presents. I mean, my dad had a very\ndistinctive wrapping style, and my mother's handwriting\nwas so close to Santa's. (Laughter) Plus, why would Santa save time\nby having to loop back to our house after he'd gone\nto everybody else's? There was only one obvious conclusion\nto reach from this mountain of evidence: our family was too strange and weird\nfor even Santa Claus to come visit, and my poor parents were trying\nto protect us from the embarrassment, this humiliation of rejection\nby Santa, who was jolly -- but let's face it,\nhe was also very judgmental. So to find out that there was\nno Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief. I left the kitchen not really\nin shock about Santa, but rather, I was just dumbfounded about how I could have missed\nthis whole age of reason thing. It was too late for me,\nbut maybe I could help someone else, someone who could use the information. They had to fit two criteria: they had to be old enough\nto be able to understand the whole concept of the age\nof reason, and not yet seven. The answer was clear:\nmy brother Bill. He was six. Well, I finally found Bill about a block away from our house\nat this public school playground. It was a Saturday,\nand he was all by himself, just kicking a ball\nagainst the side of a wall. I ran up to him and said, \"Bill! I just realized that the age of reason\nstarts when you turn seven, and then you're capable\nof committing any and all sins against God and man.\" And Bill said, \"So?\" And I said, \"So, you're six. You have a whole year to do anything\nyou want to and God won't notice it.\" And he said, \"So?\" And I said, \"So? So everything!\" And I turned to run.\nI was so angry with him. But when I got to the top of the steps, I turned around dramatically and said, \"Oh, by the way, Bill --\nthere is no Santa Claus.\" (Laughter) Now, I didn't know it at the time, but I really wasn't turning seven\non September 10th. For my 13th birthday, I planned a slumber party\nwith all of my girlfriends, but a couple of weeks beforehand\nmy mother took me aside and said, \"I need to speak to you privately. September 10th is not your birthday.\nIt's October 10th.\" And I said, \"What?\" (Laughter) And she said ... (Laughter) \"Listen. The cut-off date to start\nkindergarten was September 15th.\" (Laughter) \"So I told them that your birthday\nwas September 10th, and then I wasn't sure that you weren't just going to go\nblab it all over the place, so I started to tell you\nyour birthday was September 10th. But, Julie, you were so ready to start\nschool, honey. You were so ready.\" I thought about it, and when I was four, I was already the oldest of four children, and my mother even had\nanother child to come, so what I think she --\nunderstandably -- really meant was that she was so ready,\nshe was so ready. Then she said, \"Don't worry, Julie. Every year on October 10th, when it was your birthday\nbut you didn't realize it, I made sure that you ate\na piece of cake that day.\" (Laughter) Which was comforting, but troubling. My mother had been celebrating\nmy birthday with me, without me. (Laughter) What was so upsetting\nabout this new piece of information was not that I had to change\nthe date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends. What was most upsetting\nwas that this meant I was not a Virgo. I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom. And I read my horoscope every single day, and it was so totally me. (Laughter) And this meant that I was a Libra? So, I took the bus downtown\nto get the new Libra poster. The Virgo poster is a picture\nof a beautiful woman with long hair, sort of lounging by some water, but the Libra poster is just a huge scale. This was around the time\nthat I started filling out physically, and I was filling out a lot more\nthan a lot of the other girls, and frankly, the whole idea\nthat my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing. (Laughter) But I got the new Libra poster, and I started to read\nmy new Libra horoscope, and I was astonished to find\nthat it was also totally me. (Laughter) It wasn't until years later, looking back on this whole age-of-reason,\nchange-of-birthday thing, that it dawned on me: I wasn't turning seven\nwhen I thought I turned seven. I had a whole other month to do anything I wanted to\nbefore God started keeping tabs on me. Oh, life can be so cruel. One day, two Mormon\nmissionaries came to my door. Now, I just live off a main\nthoroughfare in Los Angeles, and my block is -- well,\nit's a natural beginning for people who are peddling\nthings door to door. Sometimes I get little old ladies\nfrom the Seventh Day Adventist Church showing me these cartoon\npictures of heaven. And sometimes I get\nteenagers who promise me that they won't join a gang\nand just start robbing people, if I only buy some\nmagazine subscriptions from them. So normally, I just ignore the doorbell,\nbut on this day, I answered. And there stood two boys, each about 19,\nin white, starched short-sleeved shirts, and they had little name tags that identified them\nas official representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ\nof Latter-day Saints, and they said they had\na message for me, from God. I said, \"A message for me? From God?\"\nAnd they said, \"Yes.\" Now, I was raised\nin the Pacific Northwest, around a lot of Church of Latter-day\nSaints people and, you know, I've worked with them and even dated them, but I never really knew the doctrine, or what they said to people\nwhen they were out on a mission, and I guess I was sort of curious,\nso I said, \"Well, please, come in.\" And they looked really happy, because I don't think this happens\nto them all that often. (Laughter) And I sat them down,\nand I got them glasses of water -- Ok, I got it, I got it. I got them glasses of water. Don't touch my hair, that's the thing. (Laughter) You can't put a video\nof myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair. Ok. (Laughter) So I sat them down\nand I got them glasses of water, and after niceties, they said, \"Do you believe that God loves you\nwith all his heart?\" And I thought, \"Well,\nof course I believe in God, but you know, I don't like\nthat word 'heart,' because it anthropomorphizes God, and I don't like the word, 'his,'\neither, because that sexualizes God.\" But I didn't want to argue\nsemantics with these boys, so after a very long,\nuncomfortable pause, I said, \"Yes, yes, I do. I feel very loved.\" And they looked at each other and smiled, like that was the right answer. And then they said, \"Do you believe that we're all brothers\nand sisters on this planet?\" And I said, \"Yes, I do.\" And I was so relieved that it was\na question I could answer so quickly. And they said, \"Well, then\nwe have a story to tell you.\" And they told me this story\nall about this guy named Lehi, who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC. Now, apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC,\neveryone was completely bad and evil. Every single one of them:\nman, woman, child, infant, fetus. And God came to Lehi and said to him, \"Put your family on a boat\nand I will lead you out of here.\" And God did lead them. He led them to America. I said, \"America? (Laughter) From Jerusalem to America\nby boat in 600 BC?\" And they said, \"Yes.\" (Laughter) Then they told me\nhow Lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced,\nand over the course of 600 years, there were two great races of them,\nthe Nephites and the Lamanites, and the Nephites were totally good --\neach and every one of them -- and the Lamanites\nwere totally bad and evil -- every single one of them\njust bad to the bone. Then, after Jesus died\non the cross for our sins, on his way up to heaven, he stopped by America\nand visited the Nephites. (Laughter) And he told them that if they all remained\ntotally, totally good -- each and every one of them -- they would win the war\nagainst the evil Lamanites. But apparently somebody blew it, because the Lamanites\nwere able to kill all the Nephites. All but one guy, this guy named Mormon, who managed to survive\nby hiding in the woods. And he made sure\nthis whole story was written down in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics\nchiseled onto gold plates, which he then buried\nnear Palmyra, New York. (Laughter) Well, I was just on the edge of my seat. (Laughter) I said, \"What happened to the Lamanites?\" And they said, \"Well, they became\nour Native Americans, here in the U.S.\" And I said, \"So, you believe\nthe Native Americans are descended from a people who were totally evil?\" And they said, \"Yes.\" Then they told me\nhow this guy named Joseph Smith found those buried gold plates\nright in his backyard, and he also found this magic stone\nback there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into, and this allowed him\nto translate the gold plates from the reformed Egyptian into English. Well, at this point I just wanted to give\nthese two boys some advice about their pitch. (Laughter) I wanted to say -- (Applause) \"Ok, don't start with this story.\" (Laughter) I mean, even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test\nbefore they start -- (Applause) telling people all about Xenu,\nthe evil intergalactic overlord. Then, they said, \"Do you believe\nthat God speaks to us through his righteous prophets?\" And I said, \"No, I don't,\" because I was sort of upset\nabout this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story, but the truth was,\nI hadn't really thought this through, so I backpedaled a little and I said, \"Well, what exactly\ndo you mean by 'righteous'? And what do you mean by prophets?\nLike, could the prophets be women?\" And they said, \"No.\" And I said, \"Why?\" And they said, \"Well, it's because\nGod gave women a gift that is so spectacular, it is so wonderful, that the only gift\nhe had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy.\" What is this wonderful gift\nGod gave women, I wondered? Maybe their greater ability\nto cooperate and adapt? (Laughter) Women's longer lifespan? The fact that women tend to be\nmuch less violent than men? But no -- it wasn't any of these gifts. They said, \"Well, it's her ability\nto bear children.\" I said, \"Oh, come on. I mean, even if women\ntried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15\nto the time they were 45, assuming they didn't die from exhaustion, it still seems like some women\nwould have some time left over to hear the word of God.\" And they said, \"No.\" (Laughter) Well, then they didn't look so\nfresh-faced and cute to me any more, but they had more to say. They said, \"Well, we also believe\nthat if you're a Mormon, and if you're in good standing\nwith the church, when you die, you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity.\" And I said, \"Oh, dear. (Laughter) That wouldn't be\nsuch a good incentive for me.\" (Laughter) And they said, \"Oh. (Laughter) Hey! Well, we also believe\nthat when you go to heaven, you get your body restored to you\nin its best original state. Like, if you'd lost a leg,\nwell, you get it back. Or, if you'd gone blind, you could see.\" I said, \"Oh. Now, I don't have a uterus, because I had cancer a few years ago. So does this mean\nthat if I went to heaven, I would get my old uterus back?\" And they said, \"Sure.\" And I said, \"I don't want it back.\nI'm happy without it.\" Gosh. What if you had a nose job\nand you liked it? (Laughter) Would God force you\nto get your old nose back? Then they gave me this Book of Mormon, told me to read\nthis chapter and that chapter, and said they'd come back\nand check in on me, and I think I said something\nlike, \"Please don't hurry,\" or maybe just, \"Please don't,\"\nand they were gone. Ok, so I initially felt\nreally superior to these boys, and smug in my more conventional faith. But then the more I thought about it,\nthe more I had to be honest with myself. If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology\nand dogma for the very first time, and they said, \"We believe that God\nimpregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse, and the fact that she was a virgin\nis maniacally important to us.\" (Laughter) \"And she had a baby,\nand that's the son of God,\" I mean, I would think\nthat's equally ridiculous. I'm just so used to that story. (Laughter) So, I couldn't let myself feel\ncondescending towards these boys. But the question they asked me\nwhen they first arrived really stuck in my head: Did I believe that God\nloved me with all his heart? Because I wasn't exactly sure\nhow I felt about that question. Now, if they had asked me, \"Do you feel that God loves\nyou with all his heart?\" Well, that would have been much different,\nI think I would have instantly answered, \"Yes, yes, I feel it all the time. I feel God's love\nwhen I'm hurt and confused, and I feel consoled and cared for. I take shelter in God's love when\nI don't understand why tragedy hits, and I feel God's love when I look\nwith gratitude at all the beauty I see.\" But since they asked me that question\nwith the word \"believe\" in it, somehow it was all different, because I wasn't exactly sure\nif I believed what I so clearly felt.",

        "transcript": "I'm going to present\nthree projects in rapid fire. I don't have much time to do it. And I want to reinforce three ideas\nwith that rapid-fire presentation. The first is what I like to call\na hyper-rational process. It's a process that takes rationality\nalmost to an absurd level, and it transcends all the baggage that normally comes\nwith what people would call, sort of a rational\nconclusion to something. And it concludes in something\nthat you see here, that you actually wouldn't expect\nas being the result of rationality. The second -- the second is that this process\ndoes not have a signature. There is no authorship. Architects are obsessed with authorship. This is something that has\nediting and it has teams, but in fact, we no longer\nsee within this process, the traditional master architect creating a sketch\nthat his minions carry out. And the third is that it challenges -- and this is, in the length of this,\nvery hard to support why, connect all these things -- but it challenges the high modernist\nnotion of flexibility. High modernists said we will create\nsort of singular spaces that are generic, almost anything can happen within them. I call it sort of \"shotgun flexibility\" -- turn your head this way; shoot;\nand you're bound to kill something. So, this is the promise of high modernism: within a single space, actually,\nany kind of activity can happen. But as we're seeing, operational costs are starting\nto dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters. And so, with this sort of idea, what happens is, whatever actually\nis in the building on opening day, or whatever seems to be\nthe most immediate need, starts to dwarf the possibility\nand sort of subsume it, of anything else could ever happen. And so we're proposing\na different kind of flexibility, something that we call\n\"compartmentalized flexibility.\" And the idea is that you,\nwithin that continuum, identify a series of points,\nand you design specifically to them. They can be pushed\noff-center a little bit, but in the end you actually\nstill get as much of that original spectrum\nas you originally had hoped. With high modernist flexibility,\nthat doesn't really work. Now I'm going to talk about -- I'm going to build up\nthe Seattle Central Library in this way before your eyes\nin about five or six diagrams, and I truly mean this is the design\nprocess that you'll see. With the library staff\nand the library board, we settled on two core positions. This is the first one, and this\nis showing, over the last 900 years, the evolution of the book,\nand other technologies. This diagram was our sort\nof position piece about the book, and our position was,\nbooks are technology -- that's something people forget -- but it's a form of technology\nthat will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent\ntechnology or media. The second premise -- and this was something\nthat was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first -- is that libraries, since the inception\nof Carnegie Library tradition in America, had a second responsibility,\nand that was for social roles. Ok, now, this I'll come back\nto later, but something -- actually, the librarians at first said,\n\"No, this isn't our mandate. Our mandate is media,\nand particularly the book.\" So what you're seeing now\nis actually the design of the building. The upper diagram is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries\nthat used high modernist flexibility. Sort of, any activity\ncould happen anywhere. We don't know the future of the library;\nwe don't know the future of the book; and so, we'll use this approach. And what we saw were buildings\nthat were very generic, and worse -- not only were they very generic -- so, not only does the reading room\nlook like the copy room look like the magazine area -- but it meant that whatever issue\nwas troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every other\nactivity that was happening in it. And in this case,\nwhat was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities\nby the expansion of the book. And so we proposed\nwhat's at the lower diagram. Very dumb approach:\nsimply compartmentalize. Put those things whose evolution\nwe could predict -- and I don't mean that we could say\nwhat would actually happen in the future, but we have some certainty of the spectrum\nof what would happen in the future -- put those in boxes designed\nspecifically for it, and put the things that we can't\npredict on the rooftops. So that was the core idea. Now, we had to convince the library that social roles were\nequally important to media, in order to get them to accept this. What you're seeing here is actually\ntheir program on the left. That's as it was given to us\nin all of its clarity and glory. Our first operation was to re-digest it\nback to them, show it to them and say, \"You know what? We haven't touched it, but only one-third of your own program\nis dedicated to media and books. Two-thirds of it is already dedicated -- that's the white band below,\nthe thing you said isn't important -- is already dedicated to social functions.\" So once we had presented\nthat back to them, they agreed that this sort\nof core concept could work. We got the right to go back\nto first principles -- that's the third diagram. We recombined everything. And then we started making new decisions. What you're seeing on the right\nis the design of the library, specifically in terms of square footage. On the left of that diagram, here,\nyou'll see a series of five platforms -- sort of combs, collective programs. And on the right are the more\nindeterminate spaces; things like reading rooms, whose evolution in 20, 30, 40 years\nwe can't predict. So that literally was the design\nof the building. They signed it, and to their chagrin, we came back a week later,\nand we presented them this. And as you can see, it is literally\nthe diagram on the right. (Laughter) We just sized -- no, really,\nI mean that, literally. The things on the left-hand side\nof the diagram, those are the boxes. We sized them into five compartments.\nThey're super-efficient. We had a very low budget to work with. We pushed them around on the site to make very literal\ncontextual relationships. The reading room\nshould be able to see the water. The main entrance should have\na public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code, and so forth. So, you see the five platforms,\nthose are the boxes. within each one, a very discrete\nthing is happening. The area in between\nis sort of an urban continuum, these things that we can't predict\ntheir evolution to the same degree. To give you some sense\nof the power of this idea, the biggest block\nis what we call the book spiral. It's literally built\nin a very inexpensive way -- it is a parking garage for books. It just so happens to be on the 6th\nthrough 10th floors of the building, but that is not necessarily\nan expensive approach. And it allows us to organize\nthe entire Dewey Decimal System on one continuous run; no matter how it\ngrows or contracts within the building, it will always have its clarity\nto end the sort of trail of tears that we've all experienced\nin public libraries. (Laughter) And so this was the final operation, which was to take these blocks\nas they were all pushed off kilter, and to hold onto them with a skin. That skin serves double duty,\nagain, for economics. One, it is the lateral stability\nfor the entire building; it's a structural element. But its dimensions were designed\nnot only for structure, but also for holding on\nevery piece of glass. The glass was then --\nI'll use the word impregnated -- but it had a layer of metal\nthat was called \"stretched metal.\" That metal acts as a microlouver, so from the exterior of the building,\nthe sun sees it as totally opaque, but from the interior,\nit's entirely transparent. So now I'm going to take you\non a tour of the building. Let me see if I can find it. For anyone who gets\nmotion sickness, I apologize. So, this is the building. And I think what's important is,\nwhen we first unveiled the building, the public saw it as being\ntotally about our whim and ego. And it was defended,\nbelieve it or not, by the librarians. They said, \"Look,\nwe don't know what it is, but we know it's everything\nthat we need it to be, based on the observations\nthat we've done about the program.\" This is going into one of the entries. So, it's an unusual building\nfor a public library, obviously. So now we're going\ninto what we call the living room. This is actually a program\nthat we invented with the library. It was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space. There are plenty of shopping malls\nthat allow you to get out of the rain in downtown Seattle, but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain. So this was an unprogrammed area where\npeople could pretty much do anything, including eat, yell,\nplay chess and so forth. Now we're moving up into what we call\nthe mixing chamber. That was the main\ntechnology area in the building. You'll have to tell me\nif I'm going too fast for you. And now up. This is actually the place\nthat we put into the building so I could propose\nto my wife, right there. (Laughter) She said yes. (Laughter) I'm running out of time,\nso I'm actually going to stop. I can show this to you later. But let's see if I can very quickly\nget into the book spiral, because I think it's,\nas I said, the most -- this is the main reading room --\nthe most unique part of the building. You dizzy yet? Ok, so here, this is the book spiral. So, it's very indiscernible, but it's actually\na continuous stair-stepping. It allows you to, on one city block, go up one full floor,\nso that it's on a continuum. Ok, now I'm going to go back,\nand I'm going to hit a second project. I'm going to go very,\nvery quickly through this. Now this is the Dallas Theater. It was an unusual client for us,\nbecause they came to us and they said, \"We need you to do a new building. We've been working\nin a temporary space for 30 years, but because of that temporary space, we've become an infamous theater company. Theater is really focused in New York,\nChicago and Seattle, with the exception\nof the Dallas Theater Company.\" And the very fact that they worked\nin a provisional space meant that for Beckett,\nthey could blow out a wall; they could do \"Cherry Orchard\" and blow\na hole through the floor, and so forth. So it was a very daunting task\nfor us to do a brand-new building that could be a pristine building, but keep this kind of experimental nature. And the second is, they were what we call\na multi-form theater, they do different kinds\nof performances in repertory. So they in the morning\nwill do something in arena, then they'll do something\nin proscenium and so forth. And so they needed to be able\nto quickly transform between different theater organizations, and for operational budget reasons, this actually no longer\nhappens in pretty much any multi-form theater\nin the United States, so we needed to figure out\na way to overcome that. So our thought was to literally\nput the theater on its head: to take those things\nthat were previously defined as front-of-house and back-of-house and stack them above house\nand below house, and to create what we called\na theater machine. We invest the money\nin the operation of the building. It's almost as though the building\ncould be placed anywhere, wherever you place it, the area under it is charged\nfor theatrical performances. And it allowed us to go back\nto first principles, and redefine fly tower, acoustic\nenclosure, light enclosure and so forth. And at the push of a button, it allows the artistic director\nto move between proscenium, thrust, and in fact, arena\nand traverse and flat floor, in a very quick transfiguration. So in fact, using\noperational budget, we can -- sorry, capital cost --\nwe can actually achieve what was no longer achievable\nin operational cost. And that means that the artistic director now has a palette that he or she\ncan choose from, between a series of forms\nand a series of processions, because that enclosure around the theater\nthat is normally trapped with front-of-house and back-of-house\nspaces has been liberated. So an artistic director has the ability\nto have a performance that enters in a Wagnerian procession, shows the first act in thrust, the intermission in a Greek procession, second act in arena, and so forth. So I'm going to show you\nwhat this actually means. This is the theater up close. Any portion around the theater\nactually can be opened discretely. The light enclosure can be lifted\nseparate to the acoustic enclosure, so you can do Beckett\nwith Dallas as the backdrop. Portions can be opened, so you can now actually have motorcycles\ndrive directly into the performance, or you can even just have\nan open-air performance, or for intermissions. The balconies all move to go\nbetween those configurations, but they also disappear. The proscenium line can also disappear. You can bring enormous objects in, so in fact, the Dallas Theater Company -- their first show will be a play\nabout Charles Lindbergh, and they'll want to bring in\na real aircraft. And then it also provides them,\nin the off-season, the ability to actually rent out\ntheir space for entirely different things. This is it from a distance. Open up entire portions\nfor different kinds of events. And at night. Again, remove the light enclosure;\nkeep the acoustic enclosure. This is a monster truck show. I'm going to show now the last project. This also is an unusual client. They inverted the whole idea\nof development. They came to us and they said --\nunlike normal developers -- they said, \"We want to start out by providing a contemporary\nart museum in Louisville. That's our main goal.\" And so instead of being a developer\nthat sees an opportunity to make money, they saw an ability to be\na catalyst in their downtown. And the fact that they wanted to support\nthe contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma, so they worked in reverse. And that pro forma led us to a mixed-use building\nthat was very large, in order to support\ntheir aspirations of the art, but it also opened up opportunities\nfor the art itself to collaborate, interact\nwith commercial spaces that actually artists more\nand more want to work within. And it also charged us\nwith thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of sub-building. So this is Louisville's skyline, and I'm going to take\nyou through the various constraints that led to the project. First: the physical constraints. We actually had to operate\non three discrete sites, all of them well smaller\nthan the size of the building. We had to operate next to the new\nMuhammad Ali Center, and respect it. We had to operate\nwithin the 100-year floodplain. Now, this area floods\nthree to four times a year, and there's a levee behind our site, similar to the ones\nthat broke in New Orleans. Had to operate behind the I-64 corridor, a street that cuts through the middle\nof these separate sites. So we're starting to build a sort of\nnightmare of constraints in a bathtub. Underneath the bathtub\nare the city's main power lines. And there is a pedestrian corridor\nthat they wanted to add, that would link a series\nof cultural buildings, and a view corridor --\nbecause this is the historic district -- that they didn't want to obstruct\nwith a new building. (Laughter) And now we're going to add\n1.1 million square feet. And if we did the traditional thing,\nthat 1.1 million square feet -- these are the different programs -- the traditional thing would be to identify\nthe public elements, place them on sites, and now we'd have a really\nterrible situation: a public thing in the middle\nof a bathtub that floods. And then we would size\nall the other elements -- the different commercial elements: hotel, luxury housing,\noffices and so forth -- and dump it on top. And we would create\nsomething that was unviable. In fact -- and you know this -- this\nis called the Time Warner Building. (Laughter) So our strategy was very simple. Just lift the entire block, flip some of the elements over, reposition them\nso they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown, and make circulation connections\nand reroute the road. So that's the basic concept, and now I'm going to show you\nwhat it leads to. Ok, it seems a very formal,\nwillful gesture, but something derived entirely\nout of the constraints. And again, when we unveiled it,\nthere was a sort of nervousness that this was about an architect\nmaking a statement, not an architect who was attempting\nto solve a series of problems. Now, within that center zone, as I said, we have the ability to mix\na series of things. So here, this is sort of an x-ray -- the towers are totally developer-driven. They told us the dimensions,\nthe sizes and so forth, and we focused on taking\nall the public components -- the lobbies, the bars -- everything that different commercial\nelements would have, and combined it in the center,\nin the sort of subway map, in the transfer zone that would also\ninclude the contemporary art museum. So it creates a situation like this,\nwhere you have artists who can operate within an art space that also has\nan amazing view on the 22nd floor, but it also has proximity that the curator\ncan either open or close. It allows people\non exercise bicycles to be seen, or to see the art, and so forth. It also means that if an artist wants\nto invade something like a swimming pool, they can begin to do their exhibition\nin a swimming pool, so they're not forced to always\nwork within the confines of a contemporary gallery space. So, how to build this. It's very simple: it's a chair. So, we begin by building the cores. As we're building the cores, we build\nthe contemporary art museum at grade. That allows us to have\nincredible efficiency and cost efficiency. This is not a high-budget building. The moment the cores get to mid level, we finish the art museum; we put\nall the mechanical equipment in it; and then we jack it up into the air. This is how they build\nreally large aircraft hangars, for instance, the ones\nthat they did for the A380. Finish the cores, finish the meat and you get something\nthat looks like this. Now I only have about 30 seconds, so I want to start an animation, and we'll conclude with that. Thank you. (Applause) Chris asked me to add -- the theater is under construction, and this project will start\nconstruction in about a year, and finish in 2010.

        "transcript": "It's wonderful to be back. I love this wonderful gathering. And you must be wondering, \"What on earth? Have they put up the wrong slide?\" No, no. Look at this magnificent beast, and ask the question: Who designed it? This is TED; this is\nTechnology, Entertainment, Design, and there's a dairy cow. It's a quite wonderfully designed animal. And I was thinking,\nhow do I introduce this? And I thought, well, maybe\nthat old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer, you know: \"Poems are made by fools\nlike me, but only God can make a tree.\" And you might say,\n\"Well, God designed the cow.\" But, of course, God got a lot of help. This is the ancestor of cattle. This is the aurochs. And it was designed by natural selection, the process of natural selection,\nover many millions of years. And then it became domesticated,\nthousands of years ago. And human beings became its stewards, and, without even knowing\nwhat they were doing, they gradually redesigned it\nand redesigned it and redesigned it. And then more recently, they really began\nto do reverse engineering on this beast and figure out just what\nthe parts were, how they worked and how they might be optimized --\nhow they might be made better. Now, why am I talking about cows? Because I want to say that\nmuch the same thing is true of religions. Religions are natural phenomena --\nthey're just as natural as cows. They have evolved over millennia. They have a biological base,\njust like the aurochs. They have become domesticated, and human beings have been redesigning\ntheir religions for thousands of years. This is TED, and I want\nto talk about design. Because what I've been doing\nfor the last four years -- really since the first time you saw me -- some of you saw me at TED\nwhen I was talking about religion -- and in the last four years, I've been working\njust about non-stop on this topic. And you might say it's about\nthe reverse engineering of religions. Now that very idea, I think,\nstrikes terror in many people, or anger, or anxiety\nof one sort or another. And that is the spell\nthat I want to break. I want to say, no, religions\nare an important natural phenomenon. We should study them\nwith the same intensity that we study all the other\nimportant natural phenomena, like global warming, as we heard\nso eloquently last night from Al Gore. Today's religions are brilliantly\ndesigned -- brilliantly designed. They are immensely powerful\nsocial institutions and many of their features\ncan be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of\nby reverse engineering. And, as with the cow, there's a mixture\nof evolutionary design -- designed by natural selection itself -- and intelligent design -- more or less intelligent design -- and redesigned by human beings who are trying\nto redesign their religions. You don't do book talks at TED, but I'm going to have\njust one slide about my book, because there is one message in it which I think this group\nreally needs to hear. And I would be very interested\nto get your responses to this. It's the one policy proposal\nthat I make in the book, at this time, when I claim\nnot to know enough about religion to know what other\npolicy proposals to make. And it's one that echoes remarks\nthat you've heard already today. Here's my proposal, I'm going to just take a couple\nof minutes to explain it: Education on world religions\nfor all of our children -- in primary school, in high school, in public schools, in private schools\nand in home schooling. So what I'm proposing is, just as we require reading, writing,\narithmetic, American history, so we should have a curriculum on facts\nabout all the religions of the world -- about their history,\nabout their creeds, about their texts, their music, their symbolisms,\ntheir prohibitions, their requirements. And this should be presented\nfactually, straightforwardly, with no particular spin,\nto all of the children in the country. And as long as you teach them that, you can teach them anything else you like. That, I think, is maximal tolerance\nfor religious freedom. As long as you inform your children\nabout other religions, then you may -- and as early as you like\nand whatever you like -- teach them whatever creed\nyou want them to learn. But also let them know\nabout other religions. Now, why do I say that? Because democracy depends\non an informed citizenship. Informed consent is the very bedrock\nof our understanding of democracy. Misinformed consent is not worth it. It's like a coin flip;\nit doesn't count, really. Democracy depends on informed consent. This is the way we treat people\nas responsible adults. Now, children below the age of consent\nare a special case. Parents -- I'm going to use a word\nthat Pastor Rick just used -- parents are stewards of their children. They don't own them. You can't own your children. You have a responsibility to the world, to the state, to them,\nto take care of them right. You may teach them whatever creed\nyou think is most important, but I say you have a responsibility\nto let them be informed about all the other creeds\nin the world, too. The reason I've taken this time\nis I've been fascinated to hear some of the reactions to this. One reviewer for a Roman Catholic\nnewspaper called it \"totalitarian.\" It strikes me as practically libertarian. Is it totalitarian to require\nreading, writing and arithmetic? I don't think so. All I'm saying is -- and facts, facts only;\nno values, just facts -- about all the world's religions. Another reviewer called it \"hilarious.\" Well, I'm really bothered by the fact that anybody would think\nthat was hilarious. It seems to me to be such a plausible, natural extension of the democratic\nprinciples we already have that I'm shocked to think anybody\nwould find that just ridiculous. I know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity\nof their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping\ntheir children ignorant of other faiths. I don't think that's defensible. But I'd really be pleased\nto get your answers on that -- any reactions to that -- later. But now I'm going to move on. Back to the cow. This picture, which I pulled\noff the web -- the fellow on the left is really\nan important part of this picture. That's the steward. Cows couldn't live without human\nstewards -- they're domesticated. They're a sort of ectosymbiont. They depend on us for their survival. And Pastor Rick\nwas just talking about sheep. I'm going to talk about sheep, too. There's a lot of serendipitous\nconvergence here. How clever it was of sheep\nto acquire shepherds! (Laughter) Think of what this got them. They could outsource all their problems: protection from predators,\nfood-finding ... (Laughter) ... health maintenance. (Laughter) The only cost in most flocks --\nnot even this -- a loss of free mating. What a deal! \"How clever of sheep!\" you might say. Except, of course,\nit wasn't the sheep's cleverness. We all know sheep are not exactly rocket\nscientists -- they're not very smart. It wasn't the cleverness\nof the sheep at all. They were clueless. But it was a very clever move. Whose clever move was it? It was the clever move\nof natural selection itself. Francis Crick, the co-discoverer\nof the structure of DNA with Jim Watson, once joked about what he called\nOrgel's Second Rule. Leslie Orgel is a molecular\nbiologist, brilliant guy, and Orgel's Second Rule is: Evolution is cleverer than you are. Now, that is not Intelligent Design --\nnot from Francis Crick. Evolution is cleverer than you are. If you understand Orgel's Second Rule,\nthen you understand why the Intelligent Design movement\nis basically a hoax. The designs discovered\nby the process of natural selection are brilliant, unbelievably brilliant. Again and again biologists are fascinated\nwith the brilliance of what's discovered. But the process itself is without purpose, without foresight, without design. When I was here four years ago, I told the story about an ant\nclimbing a blade of grass. And why the ant was doing it\nwas because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was needed\nto get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce. So it was sort of a spooky story. And I think some people\nmay have misunderstood. Lancet flukes aren't smart. I submit that the intelligence\nof a lancet fluke is down there, somewhere between petunia and carrot. They're not really bright.\nThey don't have to be. The lesson we learn from this is: you don't have to have a mind\nto be a beneficiary. The design is there in nature,\nbut it's not in anybody's head. It doesn't have to be. That's the way evolution works. Question: Was domestication\ngood for sheep? It was great for their genetic fitness. And here I want to remind you\nof a wonderful point that Paul MacCready made\nat TED three years ago. Here's what he said: \"Ten thousand years ago,\nat the dawn of agriculture, human population, plus livestock and pets, was approximately a tenth of one percent\nof the terrestrial vertebrate landmass.\" That was just 10,000 years ago. Yesterday, in biological terms. What is it today? Does anybody\nremember what he told us? 98 percent. That is what we have done on this planet. Now, I talked to Paul afterwards --\nI wanted to check to find out how he'd calculated this, and get\nthe sources and so forth -- and he also gave me a paper\nthat he had written on this. And there was a passage in it\nwhich he did not present here and I think it is so good,\nI'm going to read it to you: \"Over billions of years\non a unique sphere, chance has painted\na thin covering of life: complex, improbable,\nwonderful and fragile. Suddenly, we humans --\na recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks\nand balances inherent in nature -- have grown in population,\ntechnology and intelligence to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush.\" We heard about the atmosphere\nas a thin layer of varnish. Life itself is just a thin coat\nof paint on this planet. And we're the ones\nthat hold the paintbrush. And how can we do that? The key to our domination\nof the planet is culture. And the key to culture is religion. Suppose Martian scientists came to Earth. They would be puzzled by many things. Anybody know what this is?\nI'll tell you what it is. This is a million people gathering\non the banks of the Ganges in 2001, perhaps the largest single gathering\nof human beings ever, as seen from satellite photograph. Here's a big crowd. Here's another crowd in Mecca. Martians would be amazed by this. They'd want to know how it originated, what it was for\nand how it perpetuates itself. Actually, I'm going to pass over this. The ant isn't alone. There's all sorts of wonderful cases\nof species which -- in that case -- A parasite gets into a mouse\nand needs to get into the belly of a cat. And it turns the mouse\ninto Mighty Mouse, makes it fearless, so it runs out in the open,\nwhere it'll be eaten by a cat. True story. In other words, we have these hijackers -- you've seen this slide before,\nfrom four years ago -- a parasite that infects the brain\nand induces even suicidal behavior, on behalf of a cause\nother than one's own genetic fitness. Does that ever happen to us? Yes, it does -- quite wonderfully. The Arabic word \"Islam\"\nmeans \"submission.\" It means \"surrender of self-interest\nto the will of Allah.\" But I'm not just talking about Islam. I'm talking also about Christianity. This is a parchment music page\nthat I found in a Paris bookstall 50 years ago. And on it, it says, in Latin: \"Semen est verbum Dei.\nSator autem Christus.\" The word of God is the seed\nand the sower of the seed is Christ. Same idea. Well, not quite. But in fact, Christians, too ... glory in the fact\nthat they have surrendered to God. I'll give you a few quotes. \"The heart of worship is surrender. Surrendered people obey God's words,\neven if it doesn't make sense.\" Those words are by Rick Warren. Those are from \"The Purpose Driven Life.\" And I want to turn now, briefly,\nto talk about that book, which I've read. You've all got a copy, and you've just heard the man. And what I want to do now\nis say a bit about this book from the design standpoint, because I think it's actually\na brilliant book. First of all, the goal -- and you\nheard just now what the goal is -- it's to bring purpose to the lives\nof millions, and he has succeeded. Is it a good goal? In itself, I'm sure\nwe all agree, it is a wonderful goal. He's absolutely right. There are lots of people out there\nwho don't have purpose in their life, and bringing purpose to their life\nis a wonderful goal. I give him an A+ on this. (Laughter) Is the goal achieved? Yes. Thirty million copies of this book. Al Gore, eat your heart out. (Laughter) Just exactly what Al is trying\nto do, Rick is doing. This is a fantastic achievement. And the means -- how does he do it? It's a brilliant redesign\nof traditional religious themes -- updating them, quietly dropping\nobsolete features, putting new interpretations\non other features. This is the evolution of religion that's\nbeen going on for thousands of years, and he's just the latest\nbrilliant practitioner of it. I don't have to tell you this;\nyou just heard the man. Excellent insights into human psychology,\nwise advice on every page. Moreover, he invites us\nto look under the hood. I really appreciated that. For instance, he has an appendix\nwhere he explains his choice of translations\nof different Bible verses. The book is clear, vivid, accessible,\nbeautifully formatted. Just enough repetition. That's really important. Every time you read it or say it,\nyou make another copy in your brain. Every time you read it or say it,\nyou make another copy in your brain. (Laughter) With me, everybody -- (Audience and Dan Dennett)\nEvery time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain. Thank you. And now we come to my problem. Because I'm absolutely sincere\nin my appreciation of all that I said about this book. But I wish it were better. I have some problems with the book. And it would just be insincere of me\nnot to address those problems. I wish he could do this with a revision, a Mark 2 version of his book. \"The truth will set you free.\" That's what it says in the Bible, and it's something\nthat I want to live by, too. My problem is, some of the bits in it\nI don't think are true. Now some of this\nis a difference of opinion. And that's not my main complaint,\nthat's worth mentioning. Here's a passage -- it's very much\nwhat he said, anyway: \"If there was no God\nwe would all be accidents, the result of astronomical\nrandom chance in the Universe. You could stop reading this book\nbecause life would have no purpose or meaning or significance. There would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond\nyour brief years on Earth.\" Now, I just do not believe that. By the way, I find -- Homer Groening's\nfilm presented a beautiful alternative to that very claim. Yes, there is meaning and a reason\nfor right or wrong. We don't need a belief in God\nto be good or to have meaning in us. But that, as I said,\nis just a difference of opinion. That's not what I'm really worried about. How about this: \"God designed\nthis planet's environment just so we could live in it.\" I'm afraid that a lot of people\ntake that sentiment to mean that we don't have to do\nthe sorts of things that Al Gore is trying so hard\nto get us to do. I am not happy with that sentiment at all. And then I find this: \"All the evidence\navailable in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that\nthe cosmos is a specially designed whole with life and mankind\nas its fundamental goal and purpose, a whole in which all facets\nof reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact.\" Well, that's Michael Denton.\nHe's a creationist. And here, I think, \"Wait a minute.\"\nI read this again. I read it three or four times and I think, \"Is he really endorsing\nIntelligent Design? Is he endorsing creationism here?\" And you can't tell. So I'm sort of thinking,\n\"Well, I don't know, I don't know if I want\nto get upset with this yet.\" But then I read on, and I read this:\n\"First, Noah had never seen rain, because prior to the Flood, God irrigated\nthe earth from the ground up.\" I wish that sentence weren't in there,\nbecause I think it is false. And I think that thinking this way\nabout the history of the planet, after we've just been hearing\nabout the history of the planet over millions of years, discourages people\nfrom scientific understanding. Now, Rick Warren uses scientific terms and scientific factoids and information\nin a very interesting way. Here's one: \"God deliberately shaped\nand formed you to serve him in a way that makes your ministry unique. He carefully mixed the DNA cocktail\nthat created you.\" I think that's false. Now, maybe we want to treat it\nas metaphorical. Here's another one: \"For instance,\nyour brain can store 100 trillion facts. Your mind can handle\n15,000 decisions a second.\" Well, it would be interesting\nto find the interpretation where I would accept that. There might be some way\nof treating that as true. \"Anthropologists have noted\nthat worship is a universal urge, hardwired by God into\nthe very fiber of our being -- an inbuilt need to connect with God.\" Well, the sense of which I agree with him, except I think it has\nan evolutionary explanation. And what I find\ndeeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing\nthat if you want to be moral, if you want to have meaning in your life, you have to be an Intelligent Designer, you have to deny the theory of evolution\nby natural selection. And I think, on the contrary, that it is very important\nto solving the world's problems that we take evolutionary\nbiology seriously. Whose truth are we going to listen to? Well, this is from\n\"The Purpose Driven Life\": \"The Bible must become\nthe authoritative standard for my life: the compass I rely on for direction, the counsel I listen to\nfor making wise decisions, and the benchmark I use\nfor evaluating everything.\" Well maybe, OK, but what's going\nto follow from this? And here's one that does concern me. Remember I quoted him\nbefore with this line: \"Surrendered people obey God's word,\neven if it doesn't make sense.\" And that's a problem. (Sighs) \"Don't ever argue with the Devil. He's better at arguing than you are, having had thousands\nof years to practice.\" Now, Rick Warren\ndidn't invent this clever move. It's an old move. It's a very clever\nadaptation of religions. It's a wild card for disarming\nany reasonable criticism. \"You don't like my interpretation? You've got a reasonable objection to it? Don't listen, don't listen! That's the Devil speaking.\" This discourages the sort\nof reasoning citizenship it seems to me that we want to have. I've got one more problem,\nthen I'm through. And I'd really like to get\na response if Rick is able to do it. \"In the Great Commission, Jesus said, 'Go to all people of all nations\nand make them my disciples. Baptize them in the name of the Father,\nthe Son and the Holy Spirit, and teach them to do\neverything I've told you.'\" The Bible says Jesus is the only one\nwho can save the world. We've seen many wonderful maps\nof the world in the last day or so. Here's one, not as beautiful\nas the others; it simply shows\nthe religions of the world. Here's one that shows the sort of current\nbreakdown of the different religions. Do we really want to commit ourselves to engulfing all the other religions, when their holy books are telling them, \"Don't listen to the other side,\nthat's just Satan talking!\"? It seems to me that\nthat's a very problematic ship to get on for the future. I found this sign as I was driving\nto Maine recently, in front of a church:\n\"Good without God becomes zero.\" Sort of cute. A very clever little meme. I don't believe it and I think this idea,\npopular as it is -- not in this guise, but in general -- is itself one of the main\nproblems that we face. If you are like me, you know\nmany wonderful, committed, engaged atheists, agnostics, who are being\nvery good without God. And you also know many religious people\nwho hide behind their sanctity instead of doing good works. So, I wish we could drop this meme. I wish this meme would go extinct. Thanks very much for your attention. (Applause)"

        "transcript": "I'm often asked, \"What surprised you about the book?\" And I say, \"That I got to write it.\" I would have never imagined that. Not in my wildest dreams did I think -- I don't even consider\nmyself to be an author. And I'm often asked, \"Why do you think so many\npeople have read this? This thing's selling still\nabout a million copies a month.\" And I think it's because\nspiritual emptiness is a universal disease. I think inside at some point, we put\nour heads down on the pillow and we go, \"There's got to be more\nto life than this.\" Get up in the morning, go to work,\ncome home and watch TV, go to bed, get up in the morning, go\nto work, come home, watch TV, go to bed, go to parties on weekends. A lot of people say, \"I'm living.\" No,\nyou're not living -- that's just existing. Just existing. I really think that\nthere's this inner desire. I do believe what Chris said;\nI believe that you're not an accident. Your parents may not have planned you,\nbut I believe God did. I think there are accidental parents;\nthere's no doubt about that. I don't think there are accidental kids. And I think you matter. I think you matter to God;\nI think you matter to history; I think you matter to this universe. And I think that the difference between what I call the survival level\nof living, the success level of living, and the significance level of living is: Do you figure out,\n\"What on Earth am I here for?\" I meet a lot of people who are very smart, and say, \"But why can't I\nfigure out my problems?\" And I meet a lot of people\nwho are very successful, who say, \"Why don't I feel more fulfilled? Why do I feel like a fake? Why do I feel like I've got to pretend\nthat I'm more than I really am?\" I think that comes down to this issue\nof meaning, of significance, of purpose. I think it comes down to this issue of: \"Why am I here? What am I here for?\nWhere am I going?\" These are not religious issues. They're human issues. I wanted to tell Michael before he spoke\nthat I really appreciate what he does, because it makes my life work\na whole lot easier. As a pastor, I do see a lot of kooks. And I have learned that there are\nkooks in every area of life. Religion doesn't have a monopoly on that, but there are plenty of religious kooks. There are secular kooks;\nthere are smart kooks, dumb kooks. There are people -- a lady\ncame up to me the other day, and she had a white piece of paper --\nMichael, you'll like this one -- and she said, \"What do you see in it?\" And I looked at it and I said,\n\"Oh, I don't see anything.\" And she goes, \"Well, I see Jesus,\"\nand started crying and left. I'm going, \"OK,\" you know? \"Fine.\" (Laughter) Good for you. When the book became the best-selling book\nin the world for the last three years, I kind of had my little crisis. And that was: What is the purpose of this? Because it brought in\nenormous amounts of money. When you write the best-selling\nbook in the world, it's tons and tons of money. And it brought in a lot of attention,\nneither of which I wanted. When I started Saddleback Church,\nI was 25 years old. I started it with\none other family in 1980. And I decided that I was never\ngoing to go on TV, because I didn't want to be a celebrity. I didn't want to be a, quote,\n\"evangelist, televangelist\" -- that's not my thing. And all of the sudden, it brought a lot\nof money and a lot of attention. I don't think -- now, this is a worldview, and I will tell you,\neverybody's got a worldview. Everybody's betting\ntheir life on something. You're betting your life on something, you just better know why\nyou're betting what you're betting on. So, everybody's betting\ntheir life on something. And when I, you know, made a bet, I happened to believe\nthat Jesus was who he said he was. And I believe in a pluralistic society, everybody's betting on something. And when I started the church, you know, I had no plans\nto do what it's doing now. And then when I wrote this book, and all of a sudden, it just took off, and I started saying, now,\nwhat's the purpose of this? Because as I started to say, I don't think you're given money or fame for your own ego, ever. I just don't believe that. And when you write a book\nthat the first sentence of the book is, \"It's not about you,\" then, when all of a sudden it becomes\nthe best-selling book in history, you've got to figure, well,\nI guess it's not about me. That's kind of a no-brainer. So, what is it for? And I began to think about what I call\nthe \"stewardship of affluence\" and the \"stewardship of influence.\" So I believe, essentially,\nleadership is stewardship. That if you are a leader in any area -- in business, in politics,\nin sports, in art, in academics, in any area -- you don't own it. You are a steward of it. For instance, that's why I believe\nin protecting the environment. This is not my planet. It wasn't mine before I was born,\nit's not going to be mine after I die, I'm just here for 80 years\nand then that's it. I was debating\nthe other day on a talk show, and the guy was challenging\nme and he'd go, \"What's a pastor doing\non protecting the environment?\" And I asked this guy, I said,\n\"Well, do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better\nplace for the next generation? Do you think we have a stewardship here,\nto take the environment seriously?\" And he said, \"No.\" I said, \"Oh, you don't?\" I said, \"Let me make this clear again: Do you believe that as human beings --\nI'm not talking about religion -- do you believe that as human beings,\nit is our responsibility to take care of this planet, and make it just a little bit better\nfor the next generation?\" And he said, \"No. Not any more\nthan any other species.\" When he said the word \"species,\"\nhe was revealing his worldview. And he was saying, \"I'm no more responsible to take care\nof this environment than a duck is.\" Well now, I know a lot\nof times we act like ducks, but you're not a duck. You're not a duck. And you are responsible --\nthat's my worldview. And so, you need to understand\nwhat your worldview is. The problem is most people\nnever really think it through. They never really ... codify it or qualify it or quantify it, and say, \"This is what I believe in.\nThis is why I believe what I believe.\" I don't personally have\nenough faith to be an atheist. But you may, you may. Your worldview, though, does determine\neverything else in your life, because it determines your decisions; it determines your relationships; it determines your level of confidence. It determines, really,\neverything in your life. What we believe, obviously -- and you know this --\ndetermines our behavior, and our behavior determines\nwhat we become in life. So all of this money started pouring in, and all of this fame started pouring in. And I'm going, what do I do with this? My wife and I first made five decisions\non what to do with the money. We said, \"First, we're not\ngoing to use it on ourselves.\" I didn't go out and buy a bigger house. I don't own a guesthouse. I still drive the same four year-old\nFord that I've driven. We just said, we're not\ngoing to use it on us. The second thing was, I stopped taking a salary\nfrom the church that I pastor. Third thing is, I added up\nall that the church had paid me over the last 25 years,\nand I gave it back. And I gave it back because\nI didn't want anybody thinking that I do what I do for money -- I don't. In fact, personally, I've never met a priest or a pastor or a minister\nwho does it for money. I know that's the stereotype;\nI've never met one of them. Believe me, there's a whole lot\neasier ways to make money. Pastors are like on 24 hours-a-day call,\nthey're like doctors. I left late today -- I'd hoped\nto be here yesterday -- because my father-in-law\nis in his last, probably, 48 hours before he dies of cancer. And I'm watching a guy\nwho's lived his life -- he's now in his mid-80s --\nand he's dying with peace. You know, the test of your worldview\nis not how you act in the good times. The test of your worldview\nis how you act at the funeral. And having been through literally\nhundreds if not thousands of funerals, it makes a difference. It makes a difference what you believe. So, we gave it all back, and then we set up three foundations, working on some of the major\nproblems of the world: illiteracy, poverty, pandemic diseases --\nparticularly HIV/AIDS -- and set up these three foundations,\nand put the money into that. The last thing we did is we became\nwhat I call \"reverse tithers.\" And that is, when my wife\nand I got married 30 years ago, we started tithing. Now, that's a principle in the Bible that says give 10 percent\nof what you get back to charity, give it away to help other people. So, we started doing that, and each year\nwe would raise our tithe one percent. So, our first year of marriage\nwe went to 11 percent, second year we went to 12 percent, and the third year we went to 13 percent, and on and on and on. Why did I do that? Because every time I give, it breaks the grip\nof materialism in my life. Materialism is all about getting --\nget, get, get, get all you can, can all you get, sit on the can\nand spoil the rest. It's all about more, having more. And we think that the good life\nis actually looking good -- that's most important of all -- looking good, feeling good\nand having the goods. But that's not the good life. I meet people all the time who have\nthose, and they're not necessarily happy. If money actually made you happy, then the wealthiest people\nin the world would be the happiest. And that I know, personally,\nI know, is not true. It's just not true. So, the good life is not about looking\ngood, feeling good or having the goods, it's about being good and doing good. Giving your life away. Significance in life\ndoesn't come from status, because you can always find\nsomebody who's got more than you. It doesn't come from sex. It doesn't come from salary. It comes from serving. It is in giving our lives away\nthat we find meaning, we find significance. That's the way we were wired,\nI believe, by God. And so we began to give away, and now after 30 years, my wife and I are reverse tithers --\nwe give away 90 percent and live on 10. That, actually, was the easy part. The hard part is, what do I do\nwith all this attention? Because I started getting\nall kinds of invitations. I just came off a nearly\nmonth-long speaking tour on three different continents, and I won't go into that, but it was an amazing thing. And I'm going, what do I do\nwith this notoriety that the book has brought? And, being a pastor,\nI started reading the Bible. There's a chapter in the Bible\ncalled Psalm 72, and it's Solomon's prayer\nfor more influence. When you read this prayer, it sounds incredibly\nselfish, self-centered. He says, \"God, I want you\nto make me famous.\" That's what he prays. He said, \"I want you to make me famous. I want you to spread the fame\nof my name through every land, I want you to give me power. I want you to make me famous,\nI want you to give me influence.\" And it just sounds like the most\negotistical request you could make, if you were going to pray. Until you read the whole psalm,\nthe whole chapter. And then he says,\n\"So that the king ...\" -- he was the king of Israel\nat that time, at its apex in power -- \"... so that the king may care\nfor the widow and orphan, support the oppressed, defend\nthe defenseless, care for the sick, assist the poor,\nspeak up for the foreigner, those in prison.\" Basically, he's talking about\nall the marginalized in society. And as I read that, I looked at it, and I thought, you know, what this is saying is that the purpose\nof influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. The purpose of influence\nis not to build your ego. Or your net worth. And, by the way, your net worth is not\nthe same thing as your self-worth. Your value is not based on your valuables. It's based on a whole\ndifferent set of things. And so the purpose\nof influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. And I had to admit: I can't think of the last time\nI thought of widows and orphans. They're not on my radar. I pastor a church in one of the most\naffluent areas of America -- a bunch of gated communities. I have a church full\nof CEOs and scientists. And I could go five years and never,\never see a homeless person. They're just not in my pathway. Now, they're 13 miles\nup the road in Santa Ana. So I had to say, ok, I would use whatever affluence\nand whatever influence I've got to help those who don't have\neither of those. You know, there's a story\nin the Bible about Moses, whether you believe it's true or not,\nit really doesn't matter to me. But Moses, if you saw the movie,\n\"The Ten Commandments,\" Moses goes out, and there's this\nburning bush, and God talks to him, and God says,\n\"Moses, what's in your hand?\" I think that's one of the most important\nquestions you'll ever be asked: What's in your hand? Moses says, \"It's a staff.\nIt's a shepherd's staff.\" And God says, \"Throw it down.\" And if you saw the movie, you know,\nhe throws it down and it becomes a snake. And then God says, \"Pick it up.\" And he picks it back up again, and it becomes a staff again. Now, I'm reading this thing,\nand I'm going, what is that all about? OK. What's that all about? Well,\nI do know a couple of things. Number one, God never does\na miracle to show off. It's not just, \"Wow, isn't that cool?\" And, by the way, my God doesn't\nhave to show up on cheese bread. You know, if God's going to show up,\nhe's not going to show up on cheese bread. (Laughter) Ok? I just, this is why I love\nwhat Michael does, because it's like, if he's debunking it,\nthen I don't have to. But God -- my God --\ndoesn't show up on sprinkler images. He's got a few more powerful ways\nthan that to do whatever he wants to do. But he doesn't do miracles\njust to show off. Second thing is,\nif God ever asks you a question, he already knows the answer. Obviously, if he's God,\nthen that would mean that when he asks the question,\nit's for your benefit, not his. So he's going, \"What's in your hand?\" Now, what was in Moses' hand? Well, it was a shepherd's staff.\nNow, follow me on this. This staff represented\nthree things about Moses' life. First, it represented his identity;\nhe was a shepherd. It's the symbol of his own occupation: I am a shepherd. It's a symbol of his identity,\nhis career, his job. Second, it's a symbol\nof not only his identity, it's a symbol of his income, because all\nof his assets are tied up in sheep. In those days, nobody had bank accounts,\nor American Express cards, or hedge funds. Your assets are tied up in your flocks. So it's a symbol of his identity,\nand it's a symbol of his income. And the third thing:\nit's a symbol of his influence. What do you do with a shepherd's staff? Well, you know, you move sheep\nfrom point A to point B with it, by hook or by crook. You pull them or you poke them.\nOne or the other. So, he's saying, \"You're going to lay down your identity. What's in your hand? You've got identity, you've got income,\nyou've got influence. What's in your hand?\" And he's saying, \"If you lay it down,\nI'll make it come alive. I'll do some things\nyou could never imagine possible.\" And if you've watched that movie,\n\"Ten Commandments,\" all of those big miracles that happen\nin Egypt are done through this staff. Last year, I was invited to speak\nat the NBA All-Stars game. And so, I'm talking to the players, because most of the NBA teams,\nNFL teams and all the other teams have done this 40 Days of Purpose,\nbased on the book. And I asked them, I said,\n\"What's in your hand? So, what's in your hand?\"\nI said, \"It's a basketball. And that basketball represents\nyour identity, who you are: you're an NBA player. It represents your income: you're making a lot of money\noff that little ball. And it represents your influence. And even though you're only going\nto be in the NBA for a few years, you're going to be an NBA player\nfor the rest of your life. And that gives you enormous influence. So, what are you going to do\nwith what you've been given?\" And I guess that's the main reason\nI came up here today, to all of you very bright people at TED -- it is to say, \"What's in your hand?\" What do you have that you've been given? Talent, background, education, freedom, networks, opportunities, wealth, ideas, creativity. What are you doing\nwith what you've been given? That, to me, is the primary\nquestion about life. That, to me, is what being\npurpose-driven is all about. In the book, I talk about\nhow you're wired to do certain things, you're \"SHAPED\" with -- a little acrostic:\nSpiritual gifts, Heart, Ability, Personality and Experiences. These things shape you. And if you want to know what you ought\nto be doing with your life, you need to look at your shape --\n\"What am I wired to do?\" Why would God wire you to do something\nand then not have you do it? If you're wired to be an anthropologist,\nyou'll be an anthropologist. If you're wired to be\nan undersea explorer, you'll be an undersea explorer. If you're wired to make deals,\nyou make deals. If you're wired to paint, you paint. Did you know that God smiles\nwhen you be you? When my little kids --\nwhen my kids were little -- they're all grown now, I have grandkids -- I used to go in and sit\non the side of their bed, and I used to watch my kids sleep. And I just watched their little bodies\nrise and lower, rise and lower. And I would look at them:\n\"This is not an accident.\" Rise and lower. And I got joy out of just\nwatching them sleep. Some people have the misguided idea\nthat God only gets excited when you're doing, quote,\n\"spiritual things,\" like going to church or helping the poor, or, you know, confessing\nor doing something like that. The bottom line is, God gets pleasure\nwatching you be you. Why? He made you. And when you do what you were made to do, he goes, \"That's my boy! That's my girl! You're using the talent\nand ability that I gave you.\" So my advice to you is: look at what's in your hand -- your identity, your influence,\nyour income -- and say, \"It's not about me. It's about making the world\na better place.\" Thank you.",

                "I was seeking for my life purpose since 8 years old. I started to talk to God because I was bullied at school and started to have suicidal thoughts. I cried out, I scolded God and I also blamed God why He allowed all the bullying and rejection in my life. I talked to God almost every day. I found strength coming within although I was a Buddhist. \n\nIn end of 2014, my life hits rock bottom. I made so many mistakes and bad choices in life which I resigned my job thinking to be with someone I met online which in the end it was a scam. I was jobless and hopeless. I called out to all the God or Goddess I used to worship and I even called out to other God I can call their names including Allah and Jesus although I did not know them. I asked who was the God I used to talk to, I used to get angry with and I used to blame. But this God still helped me to stand up again and again. I asked this one true God to reveal. If there\u2019s a true God, please reveal to me.\n\nIn January 2015 I had a dream about a man in white robe. I remembered seeing the man in white robe and his robe was so white and bright. I didn't bother to look at his face as his hand was holding my hand and he took me to walk around the ancient city. I also saw few men in light brown robe walking behind us. I felt so calm and peaceful walking with the man in white robe. \n\nI woke up feeling very good as I just walked in ancient city but I did not understand my dream at all. In the same month, I also dreamt about satan in my dream. The black transparent shadow in a well-built man form. He was touching my neck until my chest from behind. I felt something evil. I tried so hard to wake up from my dream after I managed to open my eyes, I realized I can\u2019t move my body. I shouted for help but there\u2019s no voice coming out. \n\nWhen I managed to move my body I ran out from my bedroom then I saw the black shadow stood near my living room looking at me. It was the same devil I saw in my dream. I shouted for help from my mom and sis. Then they opened their bedroom door then the black transparent shadow disappeared immediately. I opened my bedroom door and I couldn\u2019t sleep although I let the light on until the next morning. I was so traumatized. I never encountered this in my life before. I thought it was ghost as I was a Buddhist that time. \n\n3 months later in mid-April, one morning I asked God how long I have to wait to understand my life purpose. I suddenly thought of a college friend whom I didn\u2019t contact for 16 years. I found her in Facebook. She invited me to church and I agreed to follow her to church as I was seeking for my life purpose. Before this, I approached numerology, astrology, tarot card reading, psychic medium to find out about my life purpose but it did not make me understand, it actually caused me to make so many bad choices and mistakes in life. \n\nAfter 2 Sunday services, I came home to look for a movie about Jesus Christ. I saw Jesus was wearing white robe in the movie and few of his disciples were in light brown robe then I suddenly recalled about the dream I had in January 2015. But I told myself not to be too emotional or jump to conclusion too fast. There was one scene when Jesus was standing at the mountain top then, Jesus began to shine with bright rays of light when God and Prophets Moses and Elijah appeared speaking to Him. I talked to myself that was the man I saw in my dream as his robe was so white and bright. But I tried to keep cool and reminded myself not to be too over excited.\n\nI watched the other half of the movie next day. I continued to watch without thinking too much about my dream but when the movie came toward the end, Jesus was carrying a cross to walk around the ancient city, I was stunned as I saw what I was seeing in my dream in January and I cried out very loud and uncontrollably. My mom and sis thought what was happening to me. I told them Jesus came into my dream and I was sure Jesus was the man in white robe who revealed to me in my dream then I was guided to church 3 months later. \n\nJesus tried to reveal to me by arranging my college friend to meet up with me and took me to church. If not I will not know Him. After that, I been through few spiritual attacks which I encountered with satan in spirit in all attacks I called out to Jesus Christ's name:\"In the name of Jesus Christ, I cast all the evil out.\" Then everything back to normal. I was stunned as I never experienced the power of Jesus Christ's name until I experienced it myself in a foreign land in Sri Lanka and also in dream and reality satan is attacking those who finds out the truth and who comes to know the one true God through Jesus Christ.\n\nI used my 9 months of jobless period to experience God through Jesus Christ. Then God has put in a desire and confident in me to seek for a job I wanted to do but always have no confident to do in training. With God's grace I got myself a career change and working as a soft skills trainer. I started to tell people about God through Jesus Christ.\n\nI wanted to help people with suicidal thoughts but satan came to stop me. I called out to Jesus Christ's name. God and satan both exist. Please get to know God through Jesus Christ, seek the truth, learn about God's words in Bible then you will learn about your true life purpose.": {

        "transcript": "I'm going to take you\non a journey very quickly. To explain the wish, I'm going\nto have to take you somewhere where many people haven't been,\nand that's around the world. When I was about 24 years old, Kate Stohr\nand myself started an organization to get architects and designers\ninvolved in humanitarian work, not only about responding\nto natural disasters, but involved in systemic issues. We believe that where the resources\nand expertise are scarce, innovative, sustainable design can really\nmake a difference in people's lives. So I started my life as an architect,\nor training as an architect, and I was always interested\nin socially responsible design, and how you can really make an impact. But when I went to architecture school, it seemed that I was\na black sheep in the family. Many architects seemed to think\nthat when you design, you design a jewel, and it's a jewel\nthat you try and crave for; whereas I felt that when you design, you either improve\nor you create a detriment to the community\nin which you're designing. So you're not just doing\na building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it,\nbut for the community as a whole. And in 1999, we started by responding\nto the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in Kosovo. And I didn't know what I was doing --\nlike I said, mid-20s -- and I'm the Internet generation,\nso we started a website. We put a call out there,\nand to my surprise, in a couple of months, we had hundreds of entries\nfrom around the world. That led to a number\nof prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas. Two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics\nin sub-Saharan Africa, responding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. That led to 550 entries from 53 countries. We also have designers\nfrom around the world that participate. And we had an exhibit\nof work that followed that. 2004 was the tipping point for us. We started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in Iran, in Bam, also following up on our work in Africa. Working within the United States -- most people look at poverty\nand they see the face of a foreigner. But I live in Bozeman, Montana -- go up to the north plains\non the reservations, or go down to Alabama\nor Mississippi, pre-Katrina, and I could have shown you\nplaces that have far worse conditions than many developing countries\nthat I've been to. So we got involved in and worked\nin inner cities and elsewhere; and also, I will go into\nsome more projects. 2005: Mother Nature kicked our ass. I think we can pretty much assume\nthat 2005 was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters. And because of the Internet, and because of connections\nto blogs and so forth, within literally hours of the tsunami,\nwe were already raising funds, getting involved, working\nwith people on the ground. We run from a couple of laptops,\nand in the first couple of days, I had 4,000 emails\nfrom people needing help. So we began to get involved\nin projects there, and I'll talk about some others. And then of course, this year\nwe've been responding to Katrina, as well as following up\non our reconstruction work. So this is a brief overview. In 2004, I really couldn't manage\nthe number of people who wanted to help, or the number of requests\nthat I was getting. It was all coming\ninto my laptop and cell phone. So we decided to embrace\nan open-source model of business -- so that anyone, anywhere in the world,\ncould start a local chapter, and they can get involved\nin local problems. Because I believe there\nis no such thing as Utopia. All problems are local.\nAll solutions are local. So that means, you know,\nsomebody who's based in Mississippi knows more about Mississippi than I do. So what happened is, we used Meetup\nand all these other Internet tools, and we ended up having\n40 chapters starting up, thousands of architects in 104 countries. So the bullet point --\nsorry, I never do a suit, so I knew that I was going\nto take this off. OK, because I'm going to do it very quick. This isn't just about nonprofit. What it showed me is that\nthere's a grassroots movement going on, of socially responsible designers\nwho really believe that this world has got a lot smaller,\nand that we have the opportunity -- not the responsibility,\nbut the opportunity -- to really get involved in making change. (Laughter) (Laughter) I'm adding that to my time. (Laughter) So what you don't know is, we've got these thousands of designers\nworking around the world, connected basically by a website,\nand we have a staff of three. The fact that nobody told us\nwe couldn't do it, we did it. And so there's something\nto be said about na\u00efvet\u00e9. So seven years later, we've developed so that we've got advocacy,\ninstigation and implementation. We advocate for good design,\nnot only through student workshops and lectures and public forums, op-eds; we have a book on humanitarian work; but also disaster mitigation\nand dealing with public policy. We can talk about FEMA,\nbut that's another talk. Instigation, developing ideas\nwith communities and NGOs, doing open-source design competitions. Referring, matchmaking with communities. And then implementing -- actually\ngoing out there and doing the work, because when you invent,\nit's never a reality until it's built. So it's really important\nthat if we're designing and trying to create change,\nwe build that change. So here's a select number of projects. Kosovo. This is Kosovo in '99. We did an open design\ncompetition, like I said. It led to a whole variety of ideas. And this wasn't about emergency shelter, but transitional shelter\nthat would last five to 10 years, that would be placed next to the land\nthe resident lived in, and that they would rebuild\ntheir own home. This wasn't imposing\nan architecture on a community; this was giving them\nthe tools and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow\nthe way they want to. We had from the sublime\nto the ridiculous, but they worked. This is an inflatable hemp house.\nIt was built; it works. This is a shipping container. Built and works. And a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with\narchitectural building, but also the issues of governance, and the idea of creating communities\nthrough complex networks. So we've engaged not just designers, but also a whole variety\nof technology-based professionals. Using rubble from destroyed homes\nto create new homes. Using straw bale construction,\ncreating heat walls. And then something remarkable\nhappened in '99. We went to Africa originally\nto look at the housing issue. Within three days, we realized\nthe problem was not housing; it was the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS. And it wasn't doctors telling us this; it was actual villagers\nthat we were staying with. And so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk\n10, 15 kilometers to see doctors, you get the doctors to the people. And we started engaging\nthe medical community, and you know, we thought\nwe were real bright sparks -- \"We've come up with this great idea: mobile health clinics, widely distributed\nthroughout sub-Saharan Africa.\" And the medical community there said, \"We've said this for the last decade. We know this. We just don't know\nhow to show this.\" So in a way, we had taken pre-existing\nneeds and shown solutions. And so again, we had a whole variety\nof ideas that came in. This one I personally love, because the idea is that architecture\nis not just about solutions, but about raising awareness. This is a kenaf clinic. You get seed and you grow it\nin a plot of land, and it grows 14 feet in a month. And on the fourth week, the doctors\ncome and they mow out an area, put a tensile structure on the top, and when the doctors\nhave finished treating and seeing patients and villagers, you cut down the clinic and you eat it. It's an eat-your-own-clinic. So it's dealing with the fact\nthat if you have AIDS, you also need to have nutrition rates, and the idea of nutrition is as important as getting antiretrovirals out there. So you know, this is a serious solution. This one I love. The idea is it's not just a clinic,\nit's a community center. This looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community, so it can be a self-sustaining project. Every one of these projects\nis sustainable. That's not because\nI'm a tree-hugging green person. It's because when you live\non four dollars a day, you're living on survival\nand you have to be sustainable. You have to know where\nyour energy is coming from, you have to know where\nyour resource is coming from, and you have to keep the maintenance down. So this is about getting\nan economic engine, and then at night,\nit turns into a movie theater. So it's not an AIDS clinic.\nIt's a community center. So you can see ideas. And these ideas developed into prototypes, and they were eventually built. And currently, as of this year, there are clinics rolling out\nin Nigeria and Kenya. From that, we also developed Siyathemba. The community came to us and said, \"The problem is that the girls\ndon't have education.\" And we're working in an area where young women\nbetween the ages of 16 and 24 have a 50 percent HIV/AIDS rate. And that's not\nbecause they're promiscuous, it's because there's no knowledge. And so we decided to look\nat the idea of sports, and create a youth sports center that doubled as an HIV/AIDS\noutreach center, and the coaches of the girls' team\nwere also trained doctors. So that there would be a very slow way\nof developing confidence in health care. And we picked nine finalists, and then those nine finalists were\ndistributed throughout the entire region, and then the community\npicked their design. They said, this is our design, because it's not only\nabout engaging a community; it's about empowering a community, and about getting them to be\na part of the rebuilding process. So, the winning design is here. And then, of course,\nwe actually go and work with the community and the clients. So this is the designer. He's out there working\nwith the first ever women's soccer team in KwaZulu-Natal, Siyathemba. And they can tell it better. (A cappella singing\nin a South African language) Video: Well, my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza. I work at the Africa Centre,\nI'm an IT user consultant. I'm also the national football player\nfor South Africa, Banyana Banyana. And I also play in the Vodacom League,\nfor the team called Tembisa, which has now changed to Siyathemba. This is our home ground. Cameron Sinclair: I'm going to show that\nlater because I'm running out of time. I can see Chris looking at me slyly. This was a connection,\njust a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop Africa's first\ntelemedicine center, in Tanzania. And we met, literally,\na couple of months ago. We've already developed a design. The team is over there,\nworking in partnership. This was a matchmaking,\nthanks to a couple of TEDsters -- Sun [Microsystems],\nCheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli, who connected me\nwith this amazing African woman. And we start construction in June,\nand it will be opened by TEDGlobal. So when you come to TEDGlobal,\nyou can check it out. But what we're known probably most for\nis dealing with disasters and development, and we've been involved\nin a lot of issues, such as the tsunami\nand also things like Hurricane Katrina. This is a 370-dollar shelter\nthat can be easily assembled. This is a community-designed\ncommunity center. And what that means is we actually\nlive and work with the community, and they're part of the design process. The kids actually get\ninvolved in mapping out where the community center should be. And then eventually, the community,\nthrough skills training, end up building the building with us. Here is another school. This is what the UN gave these guys\nfor six months -- 12 plastic tarps. This was in August. This was the replacement;\nthat's supposed to last for two years. When the rain comes down,\nyou can't hear a thing, and in the summer,\nit's about 140 degrees inside. So we said, if the rain's coming\ndown, let's get fresh water. So every one of our schools\nhas a rainwater collection system. Very low cost: three classrooms\nand rainwater collection is 5,000 dollars. This was raised by hot chocolate\nsales in Atlanta. It's built by the parents of the kids. The kids are out there on-site,\nbuilding the buildings. And it opened a couple of weeks ago, and there's 600 kids\nthat are now using the schools. (Applause) So, disaster hits home. We see the bad stories\non CNN and Fox and all that, but we don't see the good stories. Here is a community that got together,\nand they said \"no\" to waiting. They formed a partnership,\na diverse partnership of players, to actually map out East Biloxi, to figure out who's getting involved. We've had over 1,500 volunteers\nrebuilding, rehabbing homes. Figuring out what FEMA regulations are, not waiting for them to dictate\nto us how you should rebuild. Working with residents, getting them out of their homes,\nso they don't get ill. This is what they're\ncleaning up on their own. Designing housing. This house is going in\nin a couple of weeks. This is a rehabbed home,\ndone in four days. This is a utility room\nfor a woman who is on a walker. She's 70 years old.\nThis is what FEMA gave her. 600 bucks, happened two days ago. We put together, very quickly, a washroom. It's built, it's running and she just\nstarted a business today, where she's washing\nother people's clothes. These are the Calhouns. They're photographers who had documented\nthe Lower Ninth for the last 40 years. That was their home,\nand these are the photographs they took. And we're helping, working with them\nto create a new building. Projects we've done. Projects we've been a part of, support. Why don't aid agencies do this? This is the UN tent. This is the new UN tent,\njust introduced this year. Quick to assemble. It's got a flap -- that's the invention. It took 20 years to design this\nand get it implemented in the field. I was 12 years old. There's a problem here. Luckily, we're not alone. There are hundreds and hundreds\nand hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of architects\nand designers and inventors around the world that are getting\ninvolved in humanitarian work. More hemp houses -- it's a theme\nin Japan, apparently. I'm not sure what they're smoking. (Laughter) This is a Grip Clip,\ndesigned by somebody who said, \"All you need is some way\nto attach membrane structures to physical support beams.\" This guy designed for NASA,\nis now doing housing. I'm going to whip through this quickly, because I know I've got\nonly a couple of minutes. So this is all done in the last two years. I showed you something\nthat took 20 years to do. And this is just a selection of things that were built\nin the last couple of years. From Brazil to India, Mexico, Alabama, China, Israel, Palestine, Vietnam. The average age of a designer\nwho gets involved in this project is 32 -- that's how old I am. So it's a young -- I just have to stop here,\nbecause Arup is in the room, and this is the best-designed\ntoilet in the world. If you're ever, ever in India,\ngo use this toilet. (Laughter) Chris Luebkeman will tell you why. I'm sure that's how he wanted\nto spend the party. But the future is not going to be\nthe sky-scraping cities of New York, but this. And when you look at this, you see crisis. What I see is many, many inventors. One billion people live in abject poverty. We hear about them all the time. Four billion live in growing\nbut fragile economies. One in seven live\nin unplanned settlements. If we do nothing about the housing crisis\nthat's about to happen, in 20 years, one in three people\nwill live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp. Look left, look right:\none of you will be there. How do we improve the living standards\nof five billion people? With 10 million solutions. So I wish to develop a community that actively embraces\ninnovative and sustainable design to improve the living\nconditions for everyone. Chris Anderson: Wait a sec --\nthat's your wish? CS: That's my wish. CA: That's his wish! (Applause) CS: We started Architecture for Humanity\nwith 700 dollars and a website. So Chris somehow decided\nto give me 100,000. So why not this many people? Open-source architecture is the way to go. You have a diverse community\nof participants -- and we're not just talking\nabout inventors and designers, but we're talking about the funding model. My role is not as a designer; it's as a conduit between the design world\nand the humanitarian world. And what we need is something\nthat replicates me globally, because I haven't slept in seven years. (Laughter) Secondly, what will this thing be? Designers want to respond\nto issues of humanitarian crisis, but they don't want\nsome company in the West taking their idea\nand basically profiting from it. So Creative Commons has developed\nthe Developing Nations license. And what that means\nis that a designer can -- The Siyathemba project I showed was the first ever building to have\na Creative Commons license on it. As soon as that is built, anyone\nin Africa or any developing nation can take the construction documents\nand replicate it for free. (Applause) So why not allow designers\nthe opportunity to do this, but still protect their rights here? We want to have a community\nwhere you can upload ideas, and those ideas can be tested\nin an earthquake, in flood, in all sorts of austere environments. The reason that's important is I don't want to wait\nfor the next Katrina to find out if my house works. That's too late, we need to do it now. So doing that globally -- and I want this whole thing\nto work multi-lingually. When you look at the face of an architect,\nmost people think a gray-haired white guy. I don't see that;\nI see the face of the world. So I want everyone\nfrom all over the planet to be able to be a part\nof this design and development. The idea of needs-based competitions -- XPRIZE for the other 98 percent,\nif you want to call it that. We also want to look\nat ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together, and the idea of integrating\nmanufacturers -- fab labs in every country. When I hear about the $100 laptop\nand it's going to educate every child -- educate every designer in the world. Put one in every favela,\nevery slum settlement. Because you know what?\nInnovation will happen. And I need to know that.\nIt's called the leap-back. We talk about leapfrog technologies. I write with Worldchanging, and the one thing\nwe've been talking about is, I learn more on the ground\nthan I've ever learned here. So let's take those ideas,\nadapt them, and we can use them. These ideas are supposed to be adaptable; they should have\nthe potential for evolution; they should be developed\nby every nation in the world and useful for every nation in the world. What will it take? There should be a sheet. I don't have time to read this,\nbecause I'm going to be yanked off. CA: Let's just leave it up for a sec. CS: Well, what will it take?\nYou guys are smart. So it's going to take a lot\nof computing power, because I want the idea\nthat any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate\nin developing these designs, but utilize the designs. Also, a process of reviewing the designs. I want every Arup engineer\nin the world to check and make sure that we're doing stuff that's standing, because those guys\nare the best in the world. Plug. And so, you know, I want these -- I just should note: I have two laptops\nand one of them is there, and that has 3000 designs on it. If I drop that laptop ... What happens? So it's important to have\nthese proven ideas put up there, easy to use, easy to get ahold of. My mom once said, \"There's nothing worse\nthan being all mouth and no trousers.\" (Laughter) I'm fed up of talking about making change. You only make it by doing it. We've changed FEMA guidelines;\nwe've changed public policy; we've changed international response --\nbased on building things. So for me, it's important that we create\na real conduit for innovation, and that it's free innovation. Think of free culture --\nthis is free innovation. Somebody said this a couple of years back. I will give points for those who know it. But I think the man was maybe\n25 years too early. So let's do it. Thank you. (Applause)"

        "transcript": "I'm the luckiest guy in the world. I got to see the last case\nof killer smallpox in the world. I was in India this past year, and I may have seen\nthe last cases of polio in the world. There's nothing that makes\nyou feel more -- the blessing and the honor\nof working in a program like that -- than to know that something\nthat horrible no longer exists. So I'm going to tell you -- (Applause) so I'm going to show you\nsome dirty pictures. They are difficult to watch,\nbut you should look at them with optimism, because the horror\nof these pictures will be matched by the uplifting quality of knowing\nthat they no longer exist. But first, I'm going to tell you\na little bit about my own journey. My background is not exactly\nthe conventional medical education that you might expect. When I was an intern in San Francisco, I heard about a group of Native Americans\nwho had taken over Alcatraz Island, and a Native American\nwho wanted to give birth on that island, and no other doctor wanted\nto go and help her give birth. I went out to Alcatraz, and I lived\non the island for several weeks. She gave birth; I caught\nthe baby; I got off the island; I landed in San Francisco; and all the press wanted to talk to me, because my three weeks on the island\nmade me an expert in Indian affairs. (Laughter) I wound up on every television show. Someone saw me on television;\nthey called me up; and they asked me if I'd like to be in a movie\nand to play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll stars\nwho were traveling in a bus ride from San Francisco to England. And I said, yes, I would do that, so I became the doctor\nin an absolutely awful movie called \"Medicine Ball Caravan.\" (Laughter) Now, you know from the '60s, you're either on the bus\nor you're off the bus; I was on the bus. My wife of 37 years and I joined the bus. Our bus ride took us\nfrom San Francisco to London, then we switched buses at the big pond. We then got on two more buses and we drove through Turkey\nand Iran, Afghanistan, over the Khyber Pass into Pakistan,\nlike every other young doctor. This is us at the Khyber Pass,\nand that's our bus. We had some difficulty getting\nover the Khyber Pass. But we wound up in India. And then, like everyone else\nin our generation, we went to live in a Himalayan monastery. (Laughter) This is just like a residency program, for those of you\nthat are in medical school. (Laughter) And we studied with a wise man,\na guru named Karoli Baba, who then told me to get rid of the dress, put on a three-piece suit, go join the United Nations as a diplomat and work for the World\nHealth Organization. And he made an outrageous prediction\nthat smallpox would be eradicated, and that this was God's gift to humanity, because of the hard work\nof dedicated scientists. And that prediction came true. This little girl is Rahima Banu, and she was the last case\nof killer smallpox in the world. And this document is the certificate\nthat the global commission signed, certifying the world to have eradicated\nthe first disease in history. The key to eradicating smallpox\nwas early detection, early response. I'm going to ask you to repeat that:\nearly detection, early response. Can you say that? Audience: Early detection, early response. Larry Brilliant: Smallpox\nwas the worst disease in history. It killed more people\nthan all the wars in history. In the last century,\nit killed 500 million people. You're reading about Larry Page already. Somebody reads very fast. (Laughter) In the year that Larry Page\nand Sergey Brin -- with whom I have a certain affection\nand a new affiliation -- in the year in which they were born, two million people died of smallpox. We declared smallpox eradicated in 1980. This is the most important slide\nthat I've ever seen in public health, [Sovereigns killed by smallpox]\nbecause it shows you to be the richest and the strongest, and to be kings and queens of the world, did not protect you\nfrom dying of smallpox. Never can you doubt\nthat we are all in this together. But to see smallpox\nfrom the perspective of a sovereign is the wrong perspective. You should see it\nfrom the perspective of a mother, watching her child develop\nthis disease and standing by helplessly. Day one, day two, day three, day four, day five, day six. You're a mother and you're\nwatching your child, and on day six, you see\npustules that become hard. Day seven, they show the classic scars\nof smallpox umbilication. Day eight. And Al Gore said earlier that the most photographed\nimage in the world, the most printed image in the world, was that of the Earth. But this was in 1974,\nand as of that moment, this photograph was the photograph\nthat was the most widely printed, because we printed two billion copies\nof this photograph, and we took them\nhand to hand, door to door, to show people and ask them\nif there was smallpox in their house, because that was our surveillance system. We didn't have Google,\nwe didn't have web crawlers, we didn't have computers. By day nine -- you look at this picture\nand you're horrified; I look at this picture\nand I say, \"Thank God,\" because it's clear that this is only\nan ordinary case of smallpox, and I know this child will live. And by day 13, the lesions\nare scabbing, his eyelids are swollen, but you know this child has\nno other secondary infection. And by day 20, while he will be\nscarred for life, he will live. There are other kinds of smallpox\nthat are not like that. This is confluent smallpox, in which there isn't a single place\non the body where you could put a finger and not be covered by lesions. Flat smallpox, which killed 100 percent\nof people who got it. And hemorrhagic smallpox,\nthe most cruel of all, which had a predilection\nfor pregnant women. I've probably had 50 women die. They all had hemorrhagic smallpox. I've never seen anybody die from it\nwho wasn't a pregnant woman. In 1967, the WHO embarked\non what was an outrageous program to eradicate a disease. In that year, there were 34 countries\naffected with smallpox. By 1970, we were down to 18 countries. 1974, we were down to five countries. But in that year,\nsmallpox exploded throughout India. And India was the place\nwhere smallpox made its last stand. In 1974, India had\na population of 600 million. There are 21 linguistic states in India, which is like saying\n21 different countries. There are 20 million people\non the road at any time, in buses and trains, walking;\n500,000 villages, 120 million households, and none of them wanted to report if they had a case\nof smallpox in their house, because they thought that smallpox\nwas the visitation of a deity, Shitala Mata, the cooling mother, and it was wrong to bring\nstrangers into your house when the deity was in the house. No incentive to report smallpox. It wasn't just India\nthat had smallpox deities; smallpox deities were\nprevalent all over the world. So, how we eradicated smallpox was -- mass vaccination wouldn't work. You could vaccinate everybody in India, but one year later there'd be\n21 million new babies, which was then the population of Canada. It wouldn't do just to vaccinate everyone. You had to find every single\ncase of smallpox in the world at the same time, and draw\na circle of immunity around it. And that's what we did. In India alone, my 150,000 best friends\nand I went door to door, with that same picture, to every single house in India. We made over one billion house calls. And in the process,\nI learned something very important. Every time we did a house-to-house search, we had a spike in the number\nof reports of smallpox. When we didn't search, we had\nthe illusion that there was no disease. When we did search, we had the illusion\nthat there was more disease. A surveillance system was necessary, because what we needed\nwas early detection, early response. So we searched and we searched, and we found every case\nof smallpox in India. We had a reward. We raised the reward. We continued to increase the reward. We had a scorecard\nthat we wrote on every house. And as we did that, the number of reported cases\nin the world dropped to zero. And in 1980, we declared the globe\nfree of smallpox. It was the largest campaign\nin United Nations history, until the Iraq war. 150,000 people from all over the world -- doctors of every race,\nreligion, culture and nation, who fought side by side,\nbrothers and sisters, with each other, not against each other, in a common cause\nto make the world better. But smallpox was the fourth disease\nthat was intended for eradication. We failed three other times. We failed against malaria,\nyellow fever and yaws. But soon we may see polio eradicated. But the key to eradicating polio\nis early detection, early response. This may be the year we eradicate polio. That will make it\nthe second disease in history. And David Heymann, who's watching\nthis on the webcast -- David, keep on going. We're close! We're down to four countries. (Applause) I feel like Hank Aaron. Barry Bonds can replace me any time. Let's get another disease off the list\nof terrible things to worry about. I was just in India working on\nthe polio program. The polio surveillance program\nis four million people going door to door. That is the surveillance system. But we need to have\nearly detection, early response. Blindness, the same thing. The key to discovering blindness\nis doing epidemiological surveys and finding out the causes of blindness, so you can mount the correct response. The Seva Foundation\nwas started by a group of alumni of the Smallpox Eradication Programme, who, having climbed the highest mountain, tasted the elixir of the success\nof eradicating a disease, wanted to do it again. And over the last 27 years,\nSeva's programs in 15 countries have given back sight\nto more than two million blind people. Seva got started because we wanted\nto apply these lessons of surveillance and epidemiology to something which nobody else\nwas looking at as a public health issue: blindness, which heretofore had been\nthought of only as a clinical disease. In 1980, Steve Jobs gave me\nthat computer, which is Apple number 12, and it's still in Kathmandu,\nand it's still working, and we ought to go get it and auction\nit off and make more money for Seva. And we conducted the first Nepal survey\never done for health, and the first nationwide\nblindness survey ever done, and we had astonishing results. Instead of finding out\nwhat we thought was the case -- that blindness was caused mostly\nby glaucoma and trachoma -- we were astounded to find out that blindness was caused\ninstead by cataract. You can't cure or prevent\nwhat you don't know is there. In your TED packages\nthere's a DVD, \"Infinite Vision,\" about Dr. V and the Aravind Eye Hospital. I hope that you will take a look at it. Aravind, which started as a Seva project, is now the world's largest\nand best eye hospital. This year, that one hospital\nwill give back sight to more than 300,000 people\nin Tamil Nadu, India. (Applause) Bird flu. I stand here as a representative\nof all terrible things -- this might be the worst. The key to preventing\nor mitigating pandemic bird flu is early detection and rapid response. We will not have a vaccine\nor adequate supplies of an antiviral to combat bird flu if it occurs\nin the next three years. WHO stages the progress of a pandemic. We are now at stage three\non the pandemic alert stage, with just a little bit\nof human-to-human transmission, but no human-to-human-to-human\nsustained transmission. The moment WHO says\nwe've moved to category four -- this will not be like Katrina. The world as we know it will stop. There'll be no airplanes flying. Would you get in an airplane\nwith 250 people you didn't know, coughing and sneezing, when you knew that some of them\nmight carry a disease that could kill you, for which you had\nno antivirals or vaccine? I did a study of the top epidemiologists\nin the world in October. I asked them -- these are all fluologists\nand specialists in influenza -- and I asked them the questions\nyou'd like to ask them: What do you think the likelihood\nis that there'll be a pandemic? If it happens, how bad\ndo you think it will be? Fifteen percent said they thought\nthere'd be a pandemic within three years. But much worse than that, 90 percent said they thought\nthere'd be a pandemic within your children\nor your grandchildren's lifetime. And they thought\nthat if there was a pandemic, a billion people would get sick. As many as 165 million people would die. There would be a global\nrecession and depression as our just-in-time inventory system and the tight rubber band\nof globalization broke, and the cost to our economy\nof one to three trillion dollars would be far worse for everyone\nthan merely 100 million people dying, because so many more people\nwould lose their job and their healthcare benefits, that the consequences\nare almost unthinkable. And it's getting worse,\nbecause travel is getting so much better. Let me show you a simulation\nof what a pandemic looks like. So we know what we're talking about. Let's assume, for example,\nthat the first case occurs in South Asia. It initially goes quite slowly. You get two or three discrete locations. Then there'll be secondary outbreaks,\nand the disease will spread from country to country so fast\nthat you won't know what hit you. Within three weeks\nit will be everywhere in the world. Now, if we had an \"undo\" button,\nand we could go back and isolate it and grab it when it first started --\nif we could find it early, and we had early detection\nand early response, and we could put each one\nof those viruses in jail -- that's the only way to deal with\nsomething like a pandemic. And let me show you why that is. We have a joke. This is an epidemic curve,\nand everyone in medicine, I think, ultimately gets\nto know what it is. But the joke is, an epidemiologist likes to arrive\nat an epidemic right here and ride to glory on the downhill curve. (Laughter) But you don't get to do that usually. You usually arrive right about here. What we really want is to arrive\nright here, so we can stop the epidemic. But you can't always do that. But there's an organization\nthat has been able to find a way to learn when the first cases occur, and that is called GPHIN; it's the Global Public Health\nInformation Network. And that simulation that I showed you that you thought\nwas bird flu -- that was SARS. And SARS is the pandemic\nthat did not occur. And it didn't occur because GPHIN found\nthe pandemic-to-be of SARS three months before WHO actually\nannounced it, and because of that, we were able to stop the SARS pandemic. And I think we owe\na great debt of gratitude to GPHIN and to Ron St. John, who I hope is in the audience\nsome place -- over there -- who's the founder of GPHIN. (Applause) Hello, Ron! (Applause) And TED has flown Ron here\nfrom Ottawa, where GPHIN is located, because not only\ndid GPHIN find SARS early, but you may have seen last week that Iran announced\nthat they had bird flu in Iran, but GPHIN found the bird flu\nin Iran not February 14 -- but last September. We need an early-warning system to protect us against the things\nthat are humanity's worst nightmare. And so my TED wish is based on\nthe common denominator of these experiences. Smallpox -- early detection,\nearly response. Blindness, polio --\nearly detection, early response. Pandemic bird flu --\nearly detection, early response. It is a litany. It is so obvious that our only way\nof dealing with these new diseases is to find them early\nand to kill them before they spread. So, my TED wish is for you\nto help build a global system -- an early-warning system -- to protect us against\nhumanity's worst nightmares. And what I thought I would call it\nis \"Early Detection,\" But it should really be called ... \"Total Early Detection.\"\n[TED] (Laughter) What? (Applause) What? (Applause) But in all seriousness, because this idea is birthed in TED, I would like it to be\na legacy of TED, and I'd like to call it the \"International System for Total\nEarly Disease Detection.\" [INSTEDD] And INSTEDD then becomes our mantra. So instead of a hidden\npandemic of bird flu, we find it and immediately contain it. Instead of a novel virus\ncaused by bio-terror or bio-error, or shift or drift,\nwe find it and we contain it. Instead of industrial\naccidents like oil spills or the catastrophe in Bhopal, we find them, and we respond to them. Instead of famine,\nhidden until it is too late, we detect it, and we respond. And instead of a system\nwhich is owned by a government, and hidden in the bowels of government, let's build an early detection system that's freely available to anyone\nin the world in their own language. Let's make it transparent,\nnon-governmental, not owned by any single\ncountry or company, housed in a neutral country,\nwith redundant backup in a different time zone\nand a different continent. And let's build it on GPHIN. Let's start with GPHIN. Let's increase the websites\nthat they crawl from 20,000 to 20 million. Let's increase the languages they crawl from seven to 70, or more. Let's build in outbound\nconfirmation messages, using text messages or SMS\nor instant messaging to find out from people\nwho are within 100 meters of the rumor that you hear, if it is, in fact, valid. And let's add satellite confirmation. And we'll add Gapminder's\namazing graphics to the front end. And we'll grow it\nas a moral force in the world, finding out those terrible things before anybody else knows about them, and sending our response to them, so that next year,\ninstead of us meeting here, lamenting how many terrible things\nthere are in the world, we will have pulled together, used the unique skills\nand the magic of this community, and be proud that we have done\neverything we can to stop pandemics, other catastrophes, and change\nthe world, beginning right now. (Applause) Chris Anderson: An amazing presentation. First of all, just so\neveryone understands: you're saying that\nby creating web crawlers, looking on the Internet for patterns, they can detect something suspicious before WHO, before anyone else can see it? Give an example of how\nthat could possibly be true. Larry Brilliant: You're not mad\nabout the copyright violation? CA: No. I love it. (Laughter) LB: Well, as Ron St. John -- I hope you'll go and meet him\nin the dinner afterwards and talk to him. When he started GPHIN -- In 1997, there was an outbreak\nof bird flu -- H5N1. It was in Hong Kong. And a remarkable doctor in Hong Kong\nresponded immediately, by slaughtering 1.5 million\nchickens and birds, and they stopped\nthat outbreak in its tracks. Immediate detection, immediate response. Then a number of years went by, and there were a lot\nof rumors about bird flu. Ron and his team in Ottawa\nbegan to crawl the web -- only crawling 20,000 different websites,\nmostly periodicals -- and they read about\nand heard about a concern, of a lot of children who had high fever\nand symptoms of bird flu. They reported this to WHO. WHO took a little while taking action, because WHO will only receive\na report from a government, because it's the United Nations. But they were able to point\nto WHO and let them know that there was this surprising\nand unexplained cluster of illnesses that looked like bird flu. That turned out to be SARS. That's how the world found out about SARS. And because of that,\nwe were able to stop SARS. Now, what's really important is that,\nbefore there was GPHIN, 100 percent of all the world's\nreports of bad things -- whether you're talking about famine or you're talking about bird flu\nor you're talking about Ebola -- 100 percent of all those reports\ncame from nations. The moment these guys in Ottawa -- on a budget of 800,000 dollars\na year -- got cracking, 75 percent of all the reports\nin the world came from GPHIN, 25 percent of all the reports in the world came from all the other 180 nations. Now, here's what's really interesting: after they'd been working\nfor a couple years, what do you think happened\nto those nations? They felt pretty stupid. So they started sending in\ntheir reports early. And now, their reporting percentage\nis down to 50 percent, because other nations\nhave started to report. So, can you find diseases\nearly by crawling the web? Of course you can. Can you find it even earlier\nthan GPHIN does now? Of course you can. You saw that they found SARS\nusing their Chinese web crawler a full six weeks before they found it\nusing their English web crawler. Well, they're only crawling\nin seven languages. These bad viruses really\ndon't have any intention of showing up first in English\nor Spanish or French. (Laughter) So yes, I want to take GPHIN,\nI want to build on it. I want to add all the languages\nof the world that we possibly can. I want to make this open to everybody, so that the health officer\nin Nairobi or in Patna, Bihar will have as much access to it\nas the folks in Ottawa or in CDC. And I want to make it part of our culture that there is a community of people\nwho are watching out for the worst nightmares of humanity, and that it's accessible to everyone."

        "transcript": "I can't help but this wish: to think about when you're a little kid,\nand all your friends ask you, \"If a genie could give you\none wish in the world, what would it be?\" And I always answered, \"Well, I'd want the wish to have the wisdom to know\nexactly what to wish for.\" Well, then you'd be screwed, because you'd know what to wish for,\nand you'd use up your wish, and now, since we only have one wish --\nunlike last year they had three wishes -- I'm not going to wish for that. So let's get to what I would like,\nwhich is world peace. And I know what you're thinking: You're thinking, \"The poor girl up there, she thinks she's at a beauty pageant. She's not. She's at the TED Prize.\" (Laughter) But I really do think it makes sense. And I think that\nthe first step to world peace is for people to meet each other. I've met a lot of different\npeople over the years, and I've filmed some of them, from a dotcom executive in New York\nwho wanted to take over the world, to a military press officer in Qatar, who would rather not take over the world. If you've seen the film\n\"Control Room\" that was sent out, you'd understand a little bit why. (Applause) Thank you. Wow! Some of you watched it.\nThat's great. That's great. So basically what I'd like\nto talk about today is a way for people to travel, to meet people in a different way than -- because you can't travel\nall over the world at the same time. And a long time ago --\nwell, about 40 years ago -- my mom had an exchange student. And I'm going to show you\nslides of the exchange student. This is Donna. This is Donna at the Statue of Liberty. This is my mother and aunt\nteaching Donna how to ride a bike. This is Donna eating ice cream. And this is Donna teaching my aunt\nhow to do a Filipino dance. I really think as the world\nis getting smaller, it becomes more and more important that we learn each other's dance moves, that we meet each other,\nwe get to know each other, we are able to figure out\na way to cross borders, to understand each other, to understand\npeople's hopes and dreams, what makes them laugh and cry. And I know that we can't\nall do exchange programs, and I can't force everybody to travel; I've already talked about that\nto Chris and Amy, and they said that\nthere's a problem with this: You can't force people, free will. And I totally support that,\nso we're not forcing people to travel. But I'd like to talk\nabout another way to travel that doesn't require\na ship or an airplane, and just requires a movie camera,\na projector and a screen. And that's what I'm going\nto talk to you about today. I was asked that I speak a little bit\nabout where I personally come from, and Cameron, I don't know how\nyou managed to get out of that one, but I think that building bridges\nis important to me because of where I come from. I'm the daughter of an American mother and an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian father. So I'm the living product\nof two cultures coming together. No pun intended. (Laughter) And I've also been called, as an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian American\nwith a Persian name, the \"Middle East Peace Crisis.\" So maybe me starting to take\npictures was some kind of way to bring both sides\nof my family together -- a way to take the worlds with me,\na way to tell stories visually. It all kind of started that way, but I think that I really realized\nthe power of the image when I first went\nto the garbage-collecting village in Egypt, when I was about 16. My mother took me there. She's somebody who believes strongly\nin community service, and decided that this was something\nthat I needed to do. And so I went there and I met\nsome amazing women there. There was a center there, where they were teaching\npeople how to read and write, and get vaccinations\nagainst the many diseases you can get from sorting through garbage. And I began teaching there. I taught English, and I met\nsome incredible women there. I met people that live\nseven people to a room, barely can afford their evening meal, yet lived with this strength\nof spirit and sense of humor and just incredible qualities. I got drawn into this community\nand I began to take pictures there. I took pictures of weddings\nand older family members -- things that they wanted memories of. About two years after I started\ntaking these pictures, the UN Conference\non Population and Development asked me to show them at the conference. So I was 18; I was very excited. It was my first exhibit of photographs\nand they were all put up there, and after about two days,\nthey all came down except for three. People were very upset, very angry that I was showing\nthese dirty sides of Cairo, and why didn't I cut\nthe dead donkey out of the frame? And as I sat there, I got very depressed. I looked at this big empty wall\nwith three lonely photographs that were, you know,\nvery pretty photographs and I was like, \"I failed at this.\" But I was looking at this intense\nemotion and intense feeling that had come out of people\njust seeing these photographs. Here I was, this 18-year-old pipsqueak\nthat nobody listened to, and all of a sudden,\nI put these photographs on the wall, and there were arguments,\nand they had to be taken down. And I saw the power of the image,\nand it was incredible. And I think the most important reaction\nthat I saw there was actually from people that would never have gone\nto the garbage village themselves, that would never have seen\nthat the human spirit could thrive in such difficult circumstances. And I think it was at that point that I decided I wanted to use\nphotography and film to somehow bridge gaps,\nto bridge cultures, bring people together, cross borders. And so that's what really\nkind of started me off. Did a stint at MTV, made a film\ncalled \"Startup.com,\" and I've done a couple of music films. But in 2003, when the war\nin Iraq was about to start, it was a very surreal feeling for me, because before the war started, there was kind of this media war\nthat was going on. And I was watching television in New York, and there seemed to be just one\npoint of view that was coming across, and the coverage went\nfrom the US State Department to embedded troops. And what was coming across on the news was that there was going to be this\nclean war and precision bombings, and the Iraqis would be greeting\nthe Americans as liberators, and throwing flowers at their feet\nin the streets of Baghdad. And I knew that there\nwas a completely other story that was taking place in the Middle East,\nwhere my parents were. I knew that there was\na completely other story being told, and I was thinking, \"How are people\nsupposed to communicate with each other when they're getting completely\ndifferent messages, and nobody knows\nwhat the other's being told? How are people supposed to have\nany kind of common understanding or know how to move together\ninto the future? So I knew that I had to go there. I just wanted to be in the center. I had no plan. I had no funding. I didn't even have a camera at the time --\nI had somebody bring it there, because I wanted\nto get access to Al Jazeera, George Bush's favorite channel, and a place which I was very curious\nabout because it's disliked by many governments across the Arab world, and also called the mouthpiece\nof Osama Bin Laden by some people in the US government. So I was thinking, this station\nthat's hated by so many people has to be doing something right. I've got to go see what this is all about. And I also wanted to go see\nCentral Command, which was 10 minutes away. And that way, I could get access\nto how this news was being created -- on the Arab side, reaching the Arab world, and on the US and Western side,\nreaching the US. And when I went there and sat there, and met these people\nthat were in the center of it, and sat with these characters, I met some surprising,\nvery complex people. And I'd like to share with you\na little bit of that experience of when you sit with somebody and you film them, and you listen to them, and you allow them more\nthan a five-second sound bite. The amazing complexity of people emerges. Samir Khader: Business as usual. Iraq, and then Iraq, and then Iraq. But between us, if I'm offered\na job with Fox, I'll take it. To change the Arab nightmare\ninto the American dream. I still have that dream. Maybe I will never be able to do it, but I have plans for my children. When they finish high school, I will send them to America\nto study there. I will pay for their study. And they will stay there. Josh Rushing: The night they showed\nthe POWs and the dead soldiers -- Al Jazeera showed them -- it was powerful, because America\ndoesn't show those kinds of images. Most of the news in America\nwon't show really gory images and this showed American soldiers\nin uniform, strewn about a floor, a cold tile floor. And it was revolting. It was absolutely revolting. It made me sick at my stomach. And then what hit me was,\nthe night before, there had been some kind\nof bombing in Basra, and Al Jazeera had shown\nimages of the people. And they were equally, if not more,\nhorrifying -- the images were. And I remember having seen it\nin the Al Jazeera office, and thought to myself, \"Wow, that's gross. That's bad.\" And then going away, and probably\neating dinner or something. And it didn't affect me as much. So, the impact that had on me -- me realizing that I just saw\npeople on the other side, and those people in the Al Jazeera office must have felt the way\nI was feeling that night, and it upset me on a profound level that I wasn't as bothered\nas much the night before. It makes me hate war. But it doesn't make me believe\nthat we're in a world that can live without war yet. Jehane Noujaim: I was overwhelmed\nby the response of the film. We didn't know whether\nit would be able to get out there. We had no funding for it. We were incredibly lucky\nthat it got picked up. And when we showed the film in both the United States\nand the Arab world, we had such incredible reactions. It was amazing to see how people\nwere moved by this film. In the Arab world -- and it's not really by the film,\nit's by the characters -- I mean, Josh Rushing was\nthis incredibly complex person who was thinking about things. And when I showed the film\nin the Middle East, people wanted to meet Josh. He kind of redefined us\nas an American population. People started to ask me,\n\"Where is this guy now?\" Al Jazeera offered him a job. (Laughter) And Samir, on the other hand, was also quite an interesting character\nfor the Arab world to see, because it brought out the complexities\nof this love-hate relationship that the Arab world has with the West. In the United States, I was blown away\nby the motivations, the positive motivations\nof the American people when they'd see this film. You know, we're criticized abroad for believing we're the saviors\nof the world in some way, but the flip side of it is that, actually, when people do see\nwhat is happening abroad and people's reactions\nto some of our policy abroad, we feel this power, that we need to -- we feel like we have to get\nthe power to change things. And I saw this with audiences. This woman came up to me\nafter the screening and said, \"You know, I know this is crazy. I saw the bombs being loaded\non the planes, I saw the military going out to war, but you don't understand\npeople's anger towards us until you see the people in the hospitals\nand the victims of the war, and how do we get out of this bubble? How do we understand what\nthe other person is thinking?\" Now, I don't know whether\na film can change the world. But I know the power of it, I know that it starts people thinking\nabout how to change the world. Now, I'm not a philosopher, so I feel like I shouldn't\ngo into great depth on this, but let film speak for itself\nand take you to this other world. Because I believe that film has\nthe ability to take you across borders, I'd like you to just sit back\nand experience for a couple of minutes being taken into another world. And these couple clips take you inside\nof two of the most difficult conflicts that we're faced with today. [The last 48 hours of two\nPalestinian suicide bombers.] [Paradise Now] [Man: As long as there is injustice,\nsomeone must make a sacrifice!] [Woman: That's no\nsacrifice, that's revenge!] [If you kill, there's no difference\nbetween victim and occupier.] [Man: If we had airplanes, we wouldn't\nneed martyrs, that's the difference.] [Woman: The difference is that the Israeli\nmilitary is still stronger.] [Man: Then let us be equal in death.] [We still have Paradise.] [Woman: There is no Paradise!\nIt only exists in your head!] [Man: God forbid!] [May God forgive you.] [If you were not Abu Azzam's daughter ...] [Anyway, I'd rather have Paradise\nin my head than live in this hell!] [In this life, we're dead anyway.] [One only chooses bitterness\nwhen the alternative is even bitterer.] [Woman: And what about us?\nThe ones who remain?] [Will we win that way?] [Don't you see what you're\ndoing is destroying us?] [And that you give Israel\nan alibi to carry on?] [Man: So with no alibi, Israel will stop?] [Woman: Perhaps. We have\nto turn it into a moral war.] [Man: How, if Israel has no morals?] [Woman: Be careful!] [And the real people building\npeace through non-violence] [Encounter Point] Video: (Ambulance siren)\n[Tel Aviv, Israel 1996] [Tzvika: My wife Ayelet\ncalled me and said, ] [\"There was a suicide\nbombing in Tel Aviv.\"] [Ayelet: What do you know\nabout the casualties?] [Tzvika off-screen:\nWe're looking for three girls.] [We have no information.] [Ayelet: One is wounded here, but we\nhaven't heard from the other three.] [Tzvika: I said, \"OK,\nthat's Bat-Chen, that's my daughter.] [Are you sure she is dead?\"] [They said yes.] Video: (Police siren\nand shouting over megaphone) [Bethlehem, Occupied\nPalestinian Territories, 2003] [George: On that day, at around 6:30] [I was driving with my wife\nand daughters to the supermarket.] [When we got to here ...] [we saw three Israeli military jeeps\nparked on the side of the road.] [When we passed by the first jeep ...] [they opened fire on us.] [And my 12-year-old daughter Christine] [was killed in the shooting.] [Bereaved Families Forum, Jerusalem] [Tzvika: I'm the headmaster\nfor all parts.] [George: But there is a teacher\nthat is in charge?] [Tzvika: Yes, I have assistants.] [I deal with children all the time.] [One year after their daughters' deaths\nboth Tzvika and George join the forum] [George: At first, I thought\nit was a strange idea.] [But after thinking logically about it, ] [I didn't find any reason\nwhy not to meet them] [and let them know of our suffering.] [Tzvika: There were\nmany things that touched me.] [We see that there are Palestinians\nwho suffered a lot, who lost children,] [and still believe in the peace\nprocess and in reconciliation.] [If we who lost what is most precious\ncan talk to each other,] [and look forward to a better future,] [then everyone else must do so, too.] [From South Africa:\nA Revolution Through Music] [Amandla] (Music) (Video) Man: Song is something\nthat we communicated with people who otherwise would not have\nunderstood where we're coming from. You could give them\na long political speech, they would still not understand. But I tell you, when you finish that song, people will be like, \"Damn, I know\nwhere you niggas are coming from. I know where you guys are coming from. Death unto apartheid!\" Narrator: It's about\nthe liberation struggle. It's about those children\nwho took to the streets -- fighting, screaming,\n\"Free Nelson Mandela!\" It's about those unions\nwho put down their tools and demanded freedom. Yes. Yes! (Music and singing) (Singing) Freedom! (Applause) Jehane Noujaim: I think everybody's\nhad that feeling of sitting in a theater, in a dark room, with other strangers,\nwatching a very powerful film, and they felt that feeling\nof transformation. And what I'd like to talk about is how can we use that feeling to actually create\na movement through film? I've been listening to the talks\nin the conference, and Robert Wright said yesterday that if we have an appreciation\nfor another person's humanity, then they will have\nan appreciation for ours. And that's what this is about. It's about connecting people through film, getting these independent\nvoices out there. Now, Josh Rushing actually\nended up leaving the military and taking a job with Al Jazeera. (Laughter) So his feeling is that\nhe's at Al Jazeera International because he feels like\nhe can actually use media to bridge the gap between East and West. And that's an amazing thing. But I've been trying to think about ways to give power to these independent voices, to give power to the filmmakers, to give power to people who are trying\nto use film for change. And there are incredible organizations that are out there doing this already. There's Witness,\nthat you heard from earlier. There's Just Vision, that are working\nwith Palestinians and Israelis who are working together for peace,\nand documenting that process and getting interviews\nout there and using this film to take to Congress to show\nthat it's a powerful tool, to show that this is a woman who's had\nher daughter killed in an attack, and she believes that there\nare peaceful ways to solve this. There's Working Films\nand there's Current TV, which is an incredible platform\nfor people around the world to be able to put their -- (Applause) Yeah, it's amazing. I've watched it and I'm blown away by it and its potential to bring voices\nfrom around the world -- independent voices\nfrom around the world -- and create a truly democratic,\nglobal television. So what can we do to create\na platform for these organizations, to create some momentum, to get everybody in the world\ninvolved in this movement? I'd like for us to imagine for a second. Imagine a day when you have everyone\ncoming together from around the world. You have towns and villages\nand theaters -- all from around the world, getting together, and sitting in the dark, and sharing a communal\nexperience of watching a film, or a couple of films, together. Watching a film which maybe highlights\na character that is fighting to live, or just a character\nthat defies stereotypes, makes a joke, sings a song. Comedies, documentaries, shorts. This amazing power\ncan be used to change people and to bond people together;\nto cross borders, and have people feel like\nthey're having a communal experience. So if you imagine this day\nwhen all around the world, you have theaters and places\nwhere we project films. If you imagine projecting\nfrom Times Square to Tahrir Square in Cairo, the same film in Ramallah,\nthe same film in Jerusalem. You know, we've been talking\nto a friend of mine about using the side of the Great Pyramid and the Great Wall of China. It's endless what you can imagine, in terms of where you can project films and where you can have\nthis communal experience. And I believe that this one day,\nif we can create it, this one day can create momentum\nfor all of these independent voices. There isn't an organization\nwhich is connecting the independent voices of the world to get out there, and yet I'm hearing\nthroughout this conference that the biggest challenge in our future is understanding the other, and having mutual respect\nfor the other and crossing borders. And if film can do that, and if we can get all of these\ndifferent locations in the world to watch these films together -- this could be an incredible day. So we've already made a partnership, set up through somebody\nfrom the TED community, John Camen, who introduced me\nto Steven Apkon, from the Jacob Burns Film Center. And we started calling up everybody. And in the last week, there have been so many people\nthat have responded to us, from as close as Palo Alto,\nto Mongolia and to India. There are people that want to be\na part of this global day of film; to be able to provide a platform\nfor independent voices and independent films to get out there. Now, we've thought\nabout a name for this day, and I'd like to share this with you. Now, the most amazing part\nof this whole process has been sharing ideas and wishes, and so I invite you\nto give brainstorms onto how does this day echo into the future? How do we use technology to make\nthis day echo into the future, so that we can build community and have these communities working\ntogether, through the Internet? There was a time, many, many years ago, when all of the continents\nwere stuck together. And we call that landmass Pangea. So what we'd like to call this day of film\nis Pangea Cinema Day. And if you just imagine that all of these people\nin these towns would be watching, then I think that we can\nactually really make a movement towards people understanding\neach other better. I know that it's very intangible,\ntouching people's hearts and souls, but the only way that I know how to do it, the only way that I know how to reach out\nto somebody's heart and soul all across the world,\nis by showing them a film. And I know that there are independent\nfilmmakers and films out there that can really make this happen. And that's my wish. I guess I'm supposed to give you\nmy one-sentence wish, but we're way out of time. Chris Anderson:\nThat is an incredible wish. Pangea Cinema: The day\nthe world comes together. JN: It's more tangible than world peace,\nand it's certainly more immediate. But it would be the day that the world\ncomes together through film, the power of film. CA: Ladies and gentlemen, Jehane Noujaim."

        "transcript": "I'm really excited to be here today. I'll show you some stuff\nthat's just ready to come out of the lab, literally, and I'm really glad\nthat you guys are going to be among\nthe first to see it in person, because I really think this is going\nto really change the way we interact\nwith machines from this point on. Now, this is a rear-projected\ndrafting table. It's about 36 inches wide and it's equipped\nwith a multi-touch sensor. Normal touch sensors that you see, like on a kiosk\nor interactive whiteboards, can only register one point\nof contact at a time. This thing allows you to have\nmultiple points at the same time. They can use both my hands;\nI can use chording actions; I can just go right up and use\nall 10 fingers if I wanted to. You know, like that. Now, multi-touch sensing\nisn't completely new. People like Bill Buxton have been\nplaying around with it in the '80s. However, the approach I built here\nis actually high-resolution, low-cost, and probably\nmost importantly, very scalable. So, the technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing\nhere right now, other than probably\nits newfound accessibility. What's really interesting here\nis what you can do with it and the kind of interfaces\nyou can build on top of it. So let's see. So, for instance, we have\na lava lamp application here. Now, you can see, I can use both of my hands to kind\nof squeeze and put the blobs together. I can inject heat into the system here, or I can pull it apart\nwith two of my fingers. It's completely intuitive;\nthere's no instruction manual. The interface just kind of disappears. This started out as a screensaver app that one of the Ph.D. students\nin our lab, Ilya Rosenberg, made. But I think its true identity\ncomes out here. Now what's great about a multi-touch\nsensor is that, you know, I could be doing this\nwith as many fingers here, but of course multi-touch\nalso inherently means multi-user. Chris could be interacting\nwith another part of Lava, while I play around with it here. You can imagine\na new kind of sculpting tool, where I'm kind of warming something up,\nmaking it malleable, and then letting it cool down\nand solidifying in a certain state. Google should have\nsomething like this in their lobby. (Laughter) I'll show you a little more\nof a concrete example here, as this thing loads. This is a photographer's\nlight-box application. Again, I can use both of my hands\nto interact and move photos around. But what's even cooler\nis that if I have two fingers, I can actually grab a photo and then\nstretch it out like that really easily. I can pan, zoom\nand rotate it effortlessly. I can do that grossly\nwith both of my hands, or I can do it just with two fingers\non each of my hands together. If I grab the canvas, I can do\nthe same thing -- stretch it out. I can do it simultaneously,\nholding this down, and gripping on another one,\nstretching this out. Again, the interface just disappears here. There's no manual. This is exactly what you expect, especially if you haven't interacted\nwith a computer before. Now, when you have initiatives\nlike the $100 laptop, I kind of cringe at the idea of introducing a whole new\ngeneration to computing with this standard\nmouse-and-windows-pointer interface. This is something that I think\nis really the way we should be interacting\nwith machines from now on. (Applause) Now, of course, I can bring up a keyboard. (Laughter) And I can bring that around,\nput that up there. Obviously, this is a standard keyboard, but of course I can rescale it\nto make it work well for my hands. That's really important, because\nthere's no reason in this day and age that we should be conforming\nto a physical device. That leads to bad things, like RSI. We have so much technology nowadays that these interfaces\nshould start conforming to us. There's so little applied now\nto actually improving the way we interact with interfaces\nfrom this point on. This keyboard is probably actually\nthe really wrong direction to go. You can imagine, in the future,\nas we develop this kind of technology, a keyboard that kind of automatically\ndrifts as your hand moves away, and really intelligently anticipates\nwhich key you're trying to stroke. So -- again, isn't this great? (Laughter) Audience: Where's your lab? Jeff Han: I'm a research scientist\nat NYU in New York. Here's an example of another kind of app.\nI can make these little fuzz balls. It'll remember the strokes I'm making. Of course I can do it with all my hands. It's pressure-sensitive. What's neat about that is, I showed that two-finger gesture\nthat zooms in really quickly. Because you don't have\nto switch to a hand tool or the magnifying glass tool, you can just continuously make things in real multiple scales,\nall at the same time. I can create big things out here, but I can go back\nand really quickly go back to where I started,\nand make even smaller things here. This is going to be really important as we start getting to things\nlike data visualization. For instance, I think\nwe all enjoyed Hans Rosling's talk, and he really emphasized the fact\nI've been thinking about for a long time: We have all this great data, but for some reason,\nit's just sitting there. We're not accessing it. And one of the reasons why I think that is will be helped by things like graphics\nand visualization and inference tools, but I also think a big part of it is going to be having better interfaces, to be able to drill down\ninto this kind of data, while still thinking\nabout the big picture here. Let me show you another app here.\nThis is called WorldWind. It's done by NASA. We've all seen Google Earth; this is an open-source version of that. There are plug-ins to be able\nto load in different data sets that NASA's collected over the years. As you can see, I can use\nthe same two-fingered gestures to go down and go in really seamlessly. There's no interface, again. It really allows anybody\nto kind of go in -- and it just does\nwhat you'd expect, you know? Again, there's just no interface here.\nThe interface just disappears. I can switch to different data views. That's what's neat about this app here. NASA's really cool. These hyper-spectral images\nare false-colored so you can -- it's really good for determining\nvegetative use. Well, let's go back to this. The great thing\nabout mapping applications -- it's not really 2D, it's 3D. So, again, with a multi-point interface,\nyou can do a gesture like this -- so you can be able\nto tilt around like that -- (Surprised laughter) It's not just simply relegated\nto a kind of 2D panning and motion. This gesture is just putting\ntwo fingers down -- it's defining an axis of tilt --\nand I can tilt up and down that way. We just came up with that on the spot, it's probably not the right thing to do, but there's such interesting things\nyou can do with this interface. It's just so much fun\nplaying around with it, too. (Laughter) And so the last thing\nI want to show you is -- I'm sure we can all think\nof a lot of entertainment apps that you can do with this thing. I'm more interested in the creative\napplications we can do with this. Now, here's a simple application here --\nI can draw out a curve. And when I close it,\nit becomes a character. But the neat thing about it\nis I can add control points. And then what I can do is manipulate them\nwith both of my fingers at the same time. And you notice what it does. It's kind of a puppeteering thing, where I can use as many fingers\nas I have to draw and make -- Now, there's a lot of actual math\ngoing on under here for this to control this mesh\nand do the right thing. This technique of being able to manipulate\na mesh here, with multiple control points, is actually state of the art. It was released at SIGGRAPH last year. It's a great example\nof the kind of research I really love: all this compute power\nto make things do the right things, intuitive things,\nto do exactly what you expect. So, multi-touch interaction research\nis a very active field right now in HCI. I'm not the only one doing it,\na lot of other people are getting into it. This kind of technology is going to let\neven more people get into it, I'm looking forward to interacting\nwith all of you over the next few days and seeing how it can apply\nto your respective fields. Thank you. (Applause)"

        "transcript": "I've been at MIT for 44 years. I went to TED I. There's only one other person here,\nI think, who did that. All the other TEDs -- and I went to them all,\nunder Ricky's regime -- I talked about\nwhat the Media Lab was doing, which today has almost 500 people in it. And if you read the press, last week it actually said\nI quit the Media Lab. I didn't quit the Media Lab,\nI stepped down as chairman -- which was a kind of ridiculous title,\nbut someone else has taken it on -- and one of the things\nyou can do as a professor is you stay on as a professor. And I will now do for the rest of my life\nthe One Laptop Per Child, which I've sort of been doing\nfor a year and a half, anyway. So I'm going to tell you about this, use my 18 minutes\nto tell you why we're doing it, how we're doing it\nand then what we're doing. And at some point I'll even pass around what the $100 laptop might be like. I was asked by Chris\nto talk about some of the big issues, and so I figured I'd start with the three\nthat at least drove me to do this. And the first is pretty obvious. It's amazing when you meet\na head of state, and you say, \"What is your most precious\nnatural resource?\" They will not say \"children\" at first, and then when you say, \"children,\"\nthey will pretty quickly agree with you. And so that isn't very hard. (Laughter) Everybody agrees that whatever\nthe solutions are to the big problems, they include education,\nsometimes can be just education and can never be without\nsome element of education. So that's certainly part of it. And the third\nis a little bit less obvious. And that is that we all in this room\nlearned how to walk, how to talk, not by being taught how to talk,\nor taught how to walk, but by interacting with the world, by having certain results as a consequence\nof being able to ask for something, or being able to stand up and reach it. Whereas at about the age six,\nwe were told to stop learning that way, and that all learning from then on\nwould happen through teaching, whether it's people standing up,\nlike I'm doing now, or a book, or something. But it was really through teaching. And one of the things in general\nthat computers have provided to learning is that it now includes a kind of learning which is a little bit more\nlike walking and talking, in the sense that a lot of it is driven\nby the learner himself or herself. So with those as the principles -- some of you may know Seymour Papert. This is back in 1982,\nwhen we were working in Senegal. Because some people think that\nthe $100 laptop just happened a year ago, or two years ago,\nor we were struck by lightning -- this actually has gone back a long time,\nand in fact, back to the '60s. Here we're in the '80s. Steve Jobs had given us some laptops.\nWe were in Senegal. It didn't scale but it at least was bringing computers\nto developing countries and learning pretty quickly\nthat these kids, even though English wasn't their language, the Latin alphabet\nbarely was their language, but they could just swim like fish. They could play these like pianos. A little bit more recently,\nI got involved personally. And these are two anecdotes -- one was in Cambodia, in a village that has no electricity,\nno water, no television, no telephone, but has broadband Internet now. And these kids,\ntheir first English word is \"Google\" and they only know Skype. They've never heard of telephony. They just use Skype. And they go home at night -- they've got a broadband connection\nin a hut that doesn't have electricity. The parents love it,\nbecause when they open up the laptops, it's the brightest light source\nin the house. And talk about\nwhere metaphors and reality mix -- this is the actual school. In parallel with this,\nSeymour Papert got the governor of Maine to legislate one laptop per child\nin the year 2002. Now at the time, I think it's fair to say\nthat 80 percent of the teachers were -- let me say, apprehensive. Really, they were actually against it. And they really preferred\nthat the money would be used for higher salaries,\nmore schools, whatever. And now, three and a half\nyears later, guess what? They're reporting five things:\ndrop of truancy to almost zero, attending parent-teacher meetings -- which nobody did\nand now almost everybody does -- drop in discipline problems,\nincrease in student participation. Teachers are now saying\nit's kind of fun to teach. Kids are engaged -- they have laptops! -- and then the fifth,\nwhich interests me the most, is that the servers have to be turned off\nat certain times at night because the teachers\nare getting too much email from the kids asking them for help. So when you see that kind of thing -- this is not something\nthat you have to test. The days of pilot projects are over,\nwhen people say, \"We'd like to do three or four thousand\nin our country to see how it works.\" Screw you. Go to the back of the line\nand someone else will do it, and then when you figure out\nthat this works, you can join as well. And this is what we're doing. (Laughter) (Applause) So, One Laptop Per Child\nwas formed about a year and a half ago. It's a nonprofit association. It raised about 20 million dollars to do the engineering\nto just get this built, and then have it produced afterwards. Scale is truly important. And it's not important because you can\nbuy components at a lower price, OK? It's because you can go\nto a manufacturer -- and I will leave the name out -- but we wanted a small display, doesn't have to have\nperfect color uniformity. It can even have a pixel or two missing. It doesn't have to be that bright. And this particular manufacturer said, \"We're not interested in that.\nWe're interested in the living room. We're interested\nin perfect color uniformity. We're interested in big displays,\nbright displays. You're not part of our strategic plan.\" And I said, \"That's kind of too bad,\nbecause we need 100 million units a year.\" (Laughter) And they said, \"Oh, well, maybe we could\nbecome part of your strategic plan.\" And that's why scale counts. And that's why we will not launch this without five to 10 million units\nin the first run. And the idea is\nto launch with enough scale that the scale itself\nhelps bring the price down, and that's why I said\nseven to 10 million there. And we're doing it\nwithout a sales-and-marketing team. I mean, you're looking\nat the sales-and-marketing team. We will do it by going\nto seven large countries and getting them to agree and launch it, and then the others can follow. We have partners. It's not hard to guess\nGoogle would be one. The others are all playing to pending. And this has been\nin the press a great deal. It's the so-called Green Machine\nthat we introduced with Kofi Annan in November at the World Summit\nthat was held in Tunisia. Now once people start looking at this,\nthey say, \"Ah, this is a laptop project.\" Well, no, it's not a laptop project.\nIt's an education project. And the fun part --\nand I'm quite focused on it -- I tell people I used to be a light bulb,\nbut now I'm a laser -- I'm just going to get that thing built,\nand it turns out it's not so hard. Because laptop economics\nare the following: I say 50 percent here --\nit's more like 60, 60 percent of the cost of your laptop is sales, marketing,\ndistribution and profit. Now we have none of those, OK? None of those figure into our cost, because first of all, we sell it at cost,\nand the governments distribute it. It gets distributed\nto the school system like a textbook. So that piece disappears. Then you have display and everything else. Now the display on your laptop costs, in rough numbers,\n10 dollars a diagonal inch. That can drop to eight;\nit can drop to seven but it's not going to drop to two,\nor to one and a half, unless we do some pretty clever things. It's the rest -- that little brown box --\nthat is pretty fascinating, because the rest of your laptop\nis devoted to itself. It's a little bit like an obese person having to use most of their energy\nto move their obesity. (Laughter) And we have a situation today\nwhich is incredible. I've been using laptops\nsince their inception. And my laptop runs slower,\nless reliably and less pleasantly than it ever has before. And this year is worse. (Applause) People clap, sometimes\nyou even get standing ovations, and I say, \"What the hell's wrong\nwith you? Why are we all sitting there?\" And somebody -- to remain nameless --\ncalled our laptop a \"gadget\" recently. And I said, \"God, our laptop's going to go\nlike a bat out of hell. When you open it up,\nit's going to go 'bing.'\" It'll be on. It'll be just like it was in 1985, when you bought an Apple Macintosh 512. It worked really well. And we've been going steadily downhill. Now, people ask all the time what it is. That's what it is. The two pieces that are probably notable:\nit'll be a mesh network, so when the kids open up their laptops,\nthey all become a network, and then just need\none or two points of backhaul. You can serve a couple of thousand kids\nwith two megabits. So you really can bring into a village, and then the villages\ncan connect themselves, and you really can do it quite well. The dual mode display -- the idea is to have a display\nthat both works outdoors -- isn't it fun using your cell phone\noutdoors in the sunlight? Well, you can't see it. And one of the reasons you can't see it is because it's backlighting\nmost of the time, most cell phones. Now, what we're doing is, we're doing one\nthat will be both frontlit and backlit. And whether you manually switch it\nor you do it in the software is to be seen. But when it's backlit, it's color. And when it's frontlit,\nit's black and white at three times the resolution. Is it all worked out? No. That's why a lot of our people are\nmore or less living in Taiwan right now. And in about 30 days,\nwe'll know for sure whether this works. Probably the most important piece there is that the kids\nreally can do the maintenance. And this is again something\nthat people don't believe, but I really think it's quite true. That's the machine we showed in Tunis. This is more the direction\nthat we're going to go. And it's something\nthat we didn't think was possible. Now, I'm going to pass this around. This isn't a design, OK? So this is just a mechanical\nengineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with. And it's clearly just a model. The working one is at MIT. I'm going to pass it\nto this handsome gentleman. At least you can decide\nwhether it goes left or -- Chris Anderson: Before you do it,\nfor the people down in simulcast -- Nicholas Negroponte: Sorry! I forgot.\nCA: Just show it off a bit. So wherever the camera is --\nOK, good point. Thank you, Chris. The idea was that\nit would be not only a laptop, but that it could transform\ninto an electronic book. So it's sort of an electronic book. This is where when you go outside,\nit's in black and white. The games buttons are missing, but it'll also be a games machine, book machine. Set it up this way,\nand it's a television set. Etc., etc. -- is that enough\nfor simulcast? OK, sorry. I'll let Jim decide\nwhich way to send it afterwards. OK. Seven countries. (Laughter) I say \"maybe\" for Massachusetts,\nbecause they actually have to do a bid. By law you've got to bid,\nand so on and so forth. So I can't quite name them. In the other cases,\nthey don't have to do bids. They can decide -- it's the federal government in each case. It's kind of agonizing, because a lot of people say,\n\"Let's do it at the state level,\" because states are more nimble\nthan the feds, just because of size. And yet we count. We're really dealing\nwith the federal government. We're really dealing\nwith ministries of education. And if you look at governments\naround the world, ministries of education\ntend to be the most conservative, and also the ones that have huge payrolls. Everybody thinks\nthey know about education, a lot of culture is built into it as well. It's really hard.\nAnd so it's certainly the hard road. If you look at the countries,\nthey're pretty geoculturally distributed. Have they all agreed? No, not completely. Probably Thailand, Brazil and Nigeria are the three that are\nthe most active and most agreed. We're purposely\nnot signing anything with anybody until we actually have the working ones. And since I visit\neach one of those countries within at least every three months, I'm just going around the world\nevery three weeks. Here's sort of the schedule and I put at the bottom we might give some\naway free in two years at this meeting. Everybody says it's a $100 laptop -- you can't do it. Well, guess what, we're not. We're coming in probably at 135,\nto start, then drift down. And that's very important, because so many things hit the market\nat a price and then drift up. It's kind of the loss leader, and then as soon as it looks interesting, it can't be afforded,\nor it can't be scaled out. So we're targeting 50 dollars in 2010. The gray market's a big issue. And one of the ways -- just one -- but one of the ways to help\nin the case of the gray market is to make something\nthat is so utterly unique -- It's a little bit like the fact\nthat automobiles -- thousands of automobiles\nare stolen every day in the United States. Not one single\npost-office truck is stolen. (Laughter) And why? Because there's no market\nfor post-office trucks. It looks like a post-office truck. You can spray paint it.\nYou can do anything you want. I just learned recently: in South Africa,\nno white Volvos are stolen. Period. None. Zero. So we want to make it\nvery much like a white Volvo. Each government has a task force. This perhaps is less interesting, but we're trying to get the governments\nto all work together and it's not easy. The economics of this\nis to start with the federal governments and then later,\nto subsequently go to other -- whether it's child-to-child funding, so a child in this country buys one\nfor a child in the developing world, maybe of the same gender,\nmaybe of the same age. An uncle gives a niece or a nephew that\nas a birthday present. I mean, there are all sorts of things\nthat will happen, and they'll be very, very exciting. And everybody says -- I say --\nit's an education project. Are we providing the software? The answer is: The system certainly has software, but no, we're not providing\nthe education content. That is really done in the countries. But we are certainly constructionists. And we certainly believe\nin learning by doing and everything from Logo,\nwhich was started in 1968, to more modern things, like Scratch,\nif you've ever even heard of it, are very, very much part of it. And that's the rollout. Are we dreaming? Is this real? It actually is real. The only criticism, and people\nreally don't want to criticize this, because it is a humanitarian effort,\na nonprofit effort and to criticize it\nis a little bit stupid, actually. (Laughter) But the one thing\nthat people could criticize was, \"Great idea, but these guys can't do it.\" And that could either mean these guys,\nprofessors and so on couldn't do it, or that it's not possible. Well, on December 12, a company\ncalled Quanta agreed to build it, and since they make about one-third\nof all the laptops on the planet today, that question disappeared. So it's not a matter\nof whether it's going to happen. It is going to happen. And if it comes out\nat 138 dollars, so what? If it comes out six months late, so what? That's a pretty soft landing. Thank you. (Applause)"

        "transcript": "(Music) (Music ends) (Applause) (Applause ends) Hi, everyone. I'm Sirena. I'm 11 years old and from Connecticut. (Audience cheers) (Applause) Well, I'm not really sure why I'm here. (Laughter) I mean, what does this have to do\nwith technology, entertainment and design? Well, I count my iPod,\ncellphone and computer as technology, but this has nothing to do with that. So I did a little research on it. Well, this is what I found. Of course, I hope I can memorize it. (Clears throat) The violin is made of a wood box\nand four metal strings. By pulling a string, it vibrates\nand produces a sound wave, which passes through\na piece of wood called a bridge, and goes down to the wood box\nand gets amplified, but ... let me think. (Laughter) Placing your finger\nat different places on the fingerboard changes the string length, and that\nchanges the frequency of the sound wave. (Sighs) Oh, my gosh! (Laughter) OK, this is sort of technology, but I can call it\na 16th-century technology. But actually, the most\nfascinating thing that I found was that even the audio system\nor wave transmission nowadays are still based on the same principle\nof producing and projecting sound. Isn't that cool? (Laughter) (Applause) Design -- I love its design. I remember when I was little,\nmy mom asked me, \"Would you like to play\nthe violin or the piano?\" I looked at that giant monster\nand said to myself -- \"I am not going to lock myself\non that bench the whole day!\" (Laughter) This is small and lightweight. I can play from standing,\nsitting or walking. And, you know what? The best of all is that\nif I don't want to practice, (Whispering) I can hide it. (Laughter) The violin is very beautiful. Some people relate it\nas the shape of a lady. But whether you like it or not,\nit's been so for more than 400 years, unlike modern stuff\n[that] easily looks dated. But I think it's very personal\nand unique that, although each violin looks pretty similar, no two violins sound the same -- even from the same maker\nor based on the same model. Entertainment -- I love the entertainment. But actually, the instrument itself\nisn't very entertaining. I mean, when I first got my violin\nand tried to play around on it, it was actually really bad, because it didn't sound the way\nI'd heard from other kids -- it was so horrible and so scratchy. So, it wasn't entertaining at all. But besides, my brother\nfound this very funny: Yuk! Yuk! Yuk! (Laughter) A few years later, I heard a joke about the greatest violinist,\nJascha Heifetz. After Mr. Heifetz's concert, a lady came over and complimented him: \"Oh, Mr. Heifetz, your violin\nsounded so great tonight!\" And Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person, so he picked up his violin and said, \"Funny -- I don't hear anything.\" (Laughter) Now I realize that as the musician, we human beings, with our great mind,\nartistic heart and skill, can change this 16th-century technology\nand a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment. Now I know why I'm here. (Music) (Music ends) (Applause) At first, I thought I was just\ngoing to be here to perform, but unexpectedly, I learned\nand enjoyed much more. But ... although some of the talks\nwere quite up there for me. (Laughter) Like the multi-dimension stuff. I mean, honestly, I'd be happy enough if I could actually get\nmy two dimensions correct in school. (Laughter) But actually, the most\nimpressive thing to me is that -- well, actually, I would also like\nto say this for all children is to say thank you to all adults,\nfor actually caring for us a lot, and to make our future world much better. Thank you. (Applause) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause) (Applause ends) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause)",

        "transcript": "(Music) (Music ends) (Applause) Thank you! (Applause continues) Thank you very much. Like the speaker before me --\nI am a TED virgin, I guess. I'm also the first time here, and ... (Laughter) I don't know what to say! (Applause) I'm really happy\nthat Mr. Anderson invited me. I'm really grateful that I get a chance\nto play for everyone. And the song that I just played\nwas by Josef Hofmann. It's called \"Kaleidoscope.\" And Hofmann is a Polish pianist\nand composer of the late 19th century, and he's widely considered\none of the greatest pianists of all time. I have another piece\nthat I'd like to play for you. It's called \"Abegg Variations,\"\nby Robert Schumann, a German 19th-century composer. The name \"Abegg\" is actually A-B-E-G-G, and that's the main theme in the melody. (Plays the notes A, B, E, G and G) That comes from the last name\nof one of Schumann's female friends. (Laughter) But he wrote that for his wife. (Laughter) So actually, if you listen carefully, there are supposed to be\nfive variations on this Abegg theme. It's written around 1834, so even though it's old,\nI hope you'll like it. (Music) (Music ends) (Applause) Now comes the part that I hate. Well, because Mr. Anderson told me that this session is called\n\"Sync and Flow,\" I was wondering, \"What do I know\nthat these geniuses don't?\" (Laughter) So, I'll talk about musical composition, even though I don't know where to start. How do I compose? I think Yamaha does a really good job\nof teaching us how to compose. What I do first is, I make a lot\nof little musical ideas you can just improvise\nhere at the piano -- and I choose one of those\nto become my main theme, my main melody, like the Abegg that you just heard. And once I choose my main theme,\nI have to decide: Out of all the styles in music,\nwhat kind of style do I want? And this year,\nI composed a Romantic style. So for inspiration,\nI listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky and all the great Romantic composers. Next, I make the structure\nof the entire piece with my teachers. They help me plan out the whole piece. And then the hard part\nis filling it in with musical ideas, because then you have to think. (Laughter) And then, when the piece\ntakes somewhat of a solified form -- solidified, excuse me -- solidified form, you're supposed to actually\npolish the piece, polish the details, and then polish the overall\nperformance of the composition. And another thing\nthat I enjoy doing is drawing. Drawing, because I like to draw,\nyou know, Japanese anime art. I think that's a craze\namong teens right now. And once I realized it, there's a parallel between creating\nmusic and creating art, because for your motive, or your\nlittle initial idea for your drawing, it's your character -- you want\nto decide who you want to draw, or if you want to draw\nan original character. And then you want to decide:\nHow are you going to draw the character? Like, am I going to use one page?\nAm I going to draw it on the computer? Am I going to use a two-page spread\nlike a comic book? For a more grandiose effect, I guess. And then you have to do\nthe initial sketch of the character, which is like your structure of a piece, and then you add pen and pencil,\nand whatever details that you need -- that's polishing the drawing. And another thing that both of these\nhave in common is your state of mind, because I know I'm one of those teenagers\nthat are really easily distracted. So if I'm trying to do homework\nand I don't feel like it, I'll try to draw or,\nyou know, waste my time. And then what happens is,\nsometimes I absolutely can't draw or I can't compose at all, and then it's like\nthere's too much on your mind. You can't focus\non what you're supposed to do. And sometimes, if you manage to use\nyour time wisely and work on it, you'll get something out of it,\nbut it doesn't come naturally. What happens is,\nif something magical happens, if something natural happens to you, you're able to produce\nall this beautiful stuff instantly, and then that's what I consider \"flow,\" because that's when everything clicks\nand you're able to do anything. You feel like you're on top of your game\nand you can do anything you want. I'm not going to play\nmy own composition today because, although I did finish it,\nit's way too long. Instead, I'd like to try something\ncalled \"improvisation.\" I have here seven note cards, one with each note\nof the musical alphabet. And I'd like someone to come up here\nand choose five -- anyone to come up here and choose five -- and then I can make it\ninto some sort of melody, and I'll improvise it. Wow. A volunteer, yay! (Laughter) (Applause) Jennifer Lin: Nice to meet you. Goldie Hawn: Thank you. Choose five? JL: Yes, five cards. Any five cards. GH: OK, one.\nJL: OK. GH: Two.\nJL: Yes. GH: Three. GH: Oh, D and F -- too familiar. (Laughter) JL: One more.\nGH: OK. \"E\" for \"effort.\" JL: Would you mind reading them out\nin the order that you chose them? GH: OK -- C, G, B, A and E. JL: Thank you very much! GH: You're welcome. And what about these? JL: I won't use them. Thank you! (Applause) Now, she chose C, G, B, A, E. I'm going to try to put that\nin some sort of order. (Plays notes) OK, that's nice. So, I'm going to have a moment to think, and I'll try to make something out of it. (Plays the five notes) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause) The next song, or the encore\nthat I'm going to play is called \"Bumble Boogie,\" by Jack Fina. (Applause) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause)",

        "transcript": "My name is Lovegrove. I only know nine Lovegroves,\ntwo of which are my parents. They are first cousins, and you know\nwhat happens when, you know -- (Laughter) So there's a terribly weird\nfreaky side to me, which I'm fighting with all the time. So to try and get through today, I've kind of disciplined myself\nwith an 18-minute talk. I was hanging on to have a pee. I thought perhaps\nif I was hanging on long enough, that would guide me\nthrough the 18 minutes. (Laughter) OK. I am known as Captain Organic and that's a philosophical position\nas well as an aesthetic position. But today what I'd like to talk\nto you about is that love of form and how form can touch\npeople's soul and emotion. Not very long ago,\nnot many thousands of years ago, we actually lived in caves, and I don't think\nwe've lost that coding system. We respond so well to form. But I'm interested\nin creating intelligent form. I'm not interested at all in blobism or any of that superficial rubbish\nthat you see coming out as design. This artificially induced\nconsumerism -- I think it's atrocious. My world is the world\nof people like Amory Lovins, Janine Benyus, James Watson. I'm in that world,\nbut I work purely instinctively. I'm not a scientist.\nI could have been, perhaps, but I work in this world\nwhere I trust my instincts. So I am a 21st-century\ntranslator of technology into products that we use everyday\nand relate beautifully and naturally with. And we should be developing things --\nwe should be developing packaging for ideas which elevate\npeople's perceptions and respect for the things\nthat we dig out of the earth and translate into products\nfor everyday use. So, the water bottle. I'll begin with this concept\nof what I call DNA. DNA: Design, Nature, Art. These are the three things\nthat condition my world. Here is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci,\n500 years ago, before photography. It shows how observation,\ncuriosity and instinct work to create amazing art. Industrial design is the art form\nof the 21st century. People like Leonardo --\nthere have not been many -- had this amazingly instinctive curiosity. I work from a similar position. I don't want to sound\npretentious saying that, but this is my drawing made\non a digital pad a couple of years ago -- well into the 21st century,\n500 years later. It's my impression of water. Impressionism being the most valuable\nart form on the planet as we know it: 100 million dollars, easily, for a Monet. I use, now, a whole new process. A few years ago I reinvented my process to keep up with people like Greg Lynn,\nThom Mayne, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas -- all these people that I think\nare persevering and pioneering with fantastic new ideas\nof how to create form. This is all created digitally. Here you see the machining,\nthe milling of a block of acrylic. This is what I show to the client to say,\n\"That's what I want to do.\" At that point, I don't know\nif that's possible at all. It's a seductor, but I just feel\nin my bones that that's possible. So we go, we look at the tooling. We look at how that is produced. These are the invisible things\nthat you never see in your life. This is the background noise\nof industrial design. That is like an Anish Kapoor\nflowing through a Richard Serra. It is more valuable\nthan the product in my eyes. I don't have one. When I do make some money,\nI'll have one machined for myself. This is the final product. When they sent it to me,\nI thought I'd failed. It felt like nothing.\nIt has to feel like nothing. It was when I put the water in that I realized that I'd put\na skin on water itself. It's an icon of water itself, and it elevates people's perception\nof contemporary design. Each bottle is different, meaning the water level\nwill give you a different shape. It's mass individualism\nfrom a single product. It fits the hand. It fits arthritic hands.\nIt fits children's hands. It makes the product strong,\nthe tessellation. It's a millefiori of ideas. In the future, they will look like that, because we need to move away\nfrom those type of polymers and use that for medical equipment and more important things,\nperhaps, in life. Biopolymers, these new\nideas for materials, will come into play in probably a decade. It doesn't look as cool, does it? But I can live up to that.\nI don't have a problem with that. I design for that condition,\nbiopolymers. It's the future. I took this video in Cape Town last year. This is the freaky side coming out. I have this special interest\nin things like this, which blow my mind. I don't know whether to,\nyou know, drop to my knees, cry; I don't know what I think. But I just know that nature -- nature improves with ever-greater purpose that which once existed, and that strangeness\nis a consequence of innovative thinking. When I look at these things,\nthey look pretty normal to me. But these things evolved over many years,\nand what we're trying to do -- I get three weeks to design a telephone.\nHow the hell do I do that, when you get these things that take\nhundreds of millions of years to evolve? How do you condense that? It comes back to instinct. I'm not talking about designing\ntelephones that look like that and I'm not looking\nat designing architecture like that. I'm just interested\nin natural growth patterns and the beautiful forms\nthat only nature really creates. How that flows through me\nand how that comes out is what I'm trying to understand. This is a scan through the human forearm. It's then blown up\nthrough rapid prototyping to reveal its cellular structure. I have these in my office. My office is a mixture\nof the Natural History Museum and a NASA space lab. It's a weird, kind of freaky place. This is one of my specimens. This is made -- bone is made from a mixture\nof inorganic minerals and polymers. I studied cooking in school\nfor four years, and in that experience, which was called \"domestic science,\" it was a bit of a cheap trick for me\nto try and get a science qualification. (Laughter) Actually, I put marijuana\nin everything I cooked -- (Laughter) And I had access to all\nthe best girls. It was fabulous. All the guys in the rugby team\ncouldn't understand. Anyway -- this is a meringue. This is another sample I have. A meringue is made exactly the same way,\nin my estimation, as a bone. It's made from\npolysaccharides and proteins. If you pour water on that, it dissolves. Could we be manufacturing\nfrom foodstuffs in the future? Not a bad idea. I don't know. I need to talk to Janine\nand a few other people about that, but I believe instinctively that\nthat meringue can become something, a car -- I don't know. I'm also interested in growth patterns: the unbridled way that nature grows things so you're not restricted by form at all. These interrelated forms,\nthey do inspire everything I do, although I might end up\nmaking something incredibly simple. This is a detail of a chair\nthat I've designed in magnesium. It shows this interlocution of elements\nand the beauty of, kind of, engineering and biological thinking, shown pretty much as a bone structure. Any one of those elements\nyou could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object. It's the world's first chair\nmade in magnesium. It cost 1.7 million dollars to develop. It's called \"Go,\" by Bernhardt, USA. It went into Time magazine in 2001\nas the new language of the 21st century. Boy. For somebody growing up in Wales\nin a little village, that's enough. It shows how you make one holistic form,\nlike the car industry, and then you break up what you need. This is an absolutely\nbeautiful way of working. It's a godly way of working. It's organic and it's essential. It's an absolutely fat-free design, and when you look at it,\nyou see human beings. When that moves into polymers, you can change the elasticity,\nthe fluidity of the form. This is an idea for a gas-injected,\none-piece polymer chair. What nature does\nis it drills holes in things. It liberates form. It takes away anything extraneous. That's what I do. I make organic things which are essential. And they look funky, too --\nbut I don't set out to make funky things because I think\nthat's an absolute disgrace. I set out to look at natural forms. If you took the idea of fractal technology\nfurther, take a membrane, shrinking it down constantly\nlike nature does -- that could be a seat for a chair. It could be a sole for a sports shoe. It could be a car blending into seats. Wow. Let's go for it.\nThat's the kind of stuff. This is what exists in nature. Observation now allows us\nto bring that natural process into the design process every day. That's what I do. This is a show\nthat's currently on in Tokyo. It's called \"Superliquidity.\"\nIt's my sculptural investigation. It's like 21st-century Henry Moore. When you see a Henry Moore, still,\nyour hair stands up. There's some amazing spiritual connect. If he was a car designer,\nphew, we'd all be driving one. In his day, he was\nthe highest taxpayer in Britain. That is the power of organic design. It contributes immensely to our -- sense of being, our sense of relationships with things, our sensuality and,\nyou know, the sort of -- even the sort of socio-erotic side,\nwhich is very important. This is my artwork.\nThis is all my process. These actually are sold as artwork.\nThey're very big prints. But this is how I get to that object. Ironically, that object was made\nby the Killarney process, which is a brand-new process here\nfor the 21st century, and I can hear Greg Lynn\nlaughing his socks off as I say that. I'll tell you about that later. When I look into these data images, I see new things. It's self-inspired. Diatomic structures, radiolaria, the things that we couldn't see\nbut we can do now -- these, again, are cored out. They're made virtually from nothing.\nThey're made from silica. Why not structures from cars like that? Coral, all these natural forces, take away what they don't need\nand they deliver maximum beauty. We need to be in that realm. I want to do stuff like that. This is a new chair which should\ncome on the market in September. It's for a company called Moroso in Italy.\nIt's a gas-injected polymer chair. Those holes you see there\nare very filtered-down, watered-down versions of the extremity\nof the diatomic structures. It goes with the flow\nof the polymer and you'll see -- there's an image coming up\nright now that shows the full thing. It's great to have companies in Italy\nwho support this way of dreaming. If you see the shadows\nthat come through that, they're actually probably\nmore important than the product, but it's the minimum it takes. The coring out of the back\nlets you breathe. It takes away any material you don't need and it actually garners flexure too. I was going to break into a dance then. This is some current work I'm doing. I'm looking at single-surface structures and how they stretch and flow. It's based on furniture typologies,\nbut that's not the end motivation. It's made from aluminum ... as opposed to aluminium, and it's grown. It's grown in my mind, and then it's grown in terms\nof the whole process that I go through. This is two weeks ago in CCP in Coventry,\nwho build parts for Bentleys and so on. It's being built as we speak and it will be on show in Phillips\nnext year in New York. I have a big show\nwith Phillips Auctioneers. When I see these animations,\noh Jesus, I'm blown away. This is what goes on\nin my studio everyday. I walk -- I'm traveling. I come back. Some guy's got that on a computer --\nthere's this like, oh my goodness. So I try to create this energy\nof invention every day in my studio. This kind of effervescent -- fully charged sense of soup\nthat delivers ideas. Single-surface products. Furniture's a good one. How you grow legs out of a surface. I would love to build this one day and perhaps I'd like\nto build it also out of flour, sugar, polymer, wood chips --\nI don't know, human hair. I don't know. I'd love a go at that.\nI don't know. If I just got some time. That's the weird side coming out again.\nA lot of companies don't understand that. Three weeks ago I was with Sony in Tokyo. They said, \"Give us the dream.\nWhat is our dream? How do we beat Apple?\" I said, \"You don't copy Apple,\nthat's for sure. You get into biopolymers.\" They looked straight through me. What a waste. Anyway. (Laughter) No, it's true. Fuck them.\nYou know, I mean -- (Laughter) I'm delivering; they're not taking. I've had this image 20 years. I've had this image of a water droplet\nfor 20 years, sitting on a hot bed. That is an image of a car for me. That's the car of the future.\nIt's a water droplet. I've been banging on about this\nlike I can't believe. Cars are all wrong. I'm going to show you\nsomething a bit weird now. They laughed everywhere\nover the world I showed this. The only place\nthat didn't laugh was Moscow. Cars are made from 30,000 components. How ridiculous is that?\nCouldn't you make that from 300? It's got a vacuum-formed,\ncarbon-nylon pan. Everything's holistically integrated.\nIt opens and closes like a bread bin. There is no engine.\nThere's a solar panel on the back and there are batteries in the wheels;\nthey're fitted like Formula 1. You take them off your wall,\nyou plug them in. Off you go. A three-wheeled car: slow, feminine, transparent, so you can see\nthe people in there. You drive different. You see that thing. You do. You do. And not anesthetized, separated from life. There's a hole at the front\nand there's a reason for that. It's a city car.\nYou drive along. You get out. You drive on to a proboscis. You get out. It lifts you up. It presents the solar panel to the sun,\nand at night, it's a street lamp. (Applause) That's what happens if you get inspired\nby the street lamp first, and do the car second. I can see these bubbles\nwith these hydrogen packages, floating around\non the ground, driven by AI. When I showed this in South Africa, everybody afterwards was going,\n\"Hey, car on a stick. Like this.\" Can you imagine? A car on a stick. (Laughter) If you put it next to\ncontemporary architecture, it feels totally natural to me. And that's what I do with my furniture. I'm not putting Charles Eames'\nfurniture in buildings anymore. I'm trying to build furniture\nwhich fits architecture. I'm trying to build\ntransportation systems. I work on aircraft for Airbus, I do all this sort of stuff trying to force these natural,\ninspired-by-nature dreams home. I'm going to finish on two things. This is the stereolithography\nof a staircase. It's a little bit of a dedication\nto James, James Watson. I built this thing for my studio. It cost me 250,000 dollars to build this. Most people go and buy the Aston Martin. I built this. This is the data that goes with that.\nIncredibly complex. Took about two years,\nbecause I'm looking for fat-free design. Lean, efficient things. Healthy products. This is built by composites. It's a single element which rotates around\nto create a holistic element, and this is a carbon-fiber handrail\nwhich is only supported in two places. Modern materials\nallow us to do modern things. This is a shot in the studio. This is how it looks\npretty much every day. You wouldn't want to have\na fear of heights coming down it. There is virtually no handrail.\nIt doesn't pass any standards. (Laughter) Who cares? (Laughter) And it has an internal handrail\nwhich gives it its strength. It's this holistic integration.\nThat's my studio. It's subterranean. It's in Notting Hill,\nnext to all the crap -- the prostitutes and all that stuff. It's next to David Hockney's\noriginal studio. It has a lighting system\nthat changes throughout the day. My guys go out for lunch.\nThe door's open. They come back in, because it's normally raining\nand they prefer to stay in. This is my studio. Elephant skull\nfrom Oxford University, 1988. I bought that last year.\nThey're very difficult to find. If anybody's got a whale skeleton\nthey want to sell me, I'll put it in the studio. So I'm just going\nto interject a little bit with some of the things\nthat you'll see in the video. It's a homemade video, made it myself\nat three o'clock in the morning just to show you how my real world is. You never see that. You never see architects or designers\nshowing you their real world. This is called a \"Plasnet.\" It's a new bio-polycarbonate chair\nI'm doing in Italy. World's first bamboo bike\nwith folding handlebars. We should all be riding one of these. As China buys all these crappy cars,\nwe should be riding things like this. Counterbalance. Like I say, it's a cross between Natural History Museum\nand a NASA laboratory. It's full of prototypes and objects. It's self-inspirational, again. I mean, the rare times when I'm there, I do enjoy it. And I get lots and lots of kids coming. I'm a contaminator for all those children\nof investment bankers -- wankers. Sorry. (Laughter) That's a solar seed.\nIt's a concept for new architecture. That thing on the top is the world's\nfirst solar-powered garden lamp -- the first produced. Giles Revell should be\ntalking here today -- amazing photography\nof things you can't see. The first sculptural model\nI made for that thing in Tokyo. Lots of stuff.\nThere's a little leaf chair -- that golden looking thing\nis called \"Leaf.\" It's made from Kevlar. On the wall is my book\ncalled \"Supernatural,\" which allows me to remember\nwhat I've done, because I forget. There's an aerated brick\nI did in Limoges last year, in Concepts for New Ceramics\nin Architecture. Gernot Oberfell, working\nat three o'clock in the morning -- and I don't pay overtime. Overtime is the passion of design, so join the club or don't. (Laughter) No, it's true. People like Tom and Greg -- we're traveling like you can't --\nwe fit it all in. I don't know how we do it. Next week I'm at Electrolux in Sweden,\nthen I'm in Beijing on Friday. You work that one out. And when I see Ed's photographs,\nI think, why the hell am I going to China? It's true. It's true. Because there's a soul\nin this whole thing. We need to have a new instinct\nfor the 21st century. We need to combine all this stuff. If all the people who were\ntalking over this period worked on a car together, it would be a joy, absolute joy. So there's a new X-light system\nI'm doing in Japan. There's Tuareg shoes from North Africa.\nThere's a Kifwebe mask. These are my sculptures. A copper jelly mold. (Laughter) It sounds like some quiz show\nor something, doesn't it? So, it's going to end. Thank you, James,\nfor your great inspiration. Thank you very much. (Applause)"

        "transcript": "In terms of invention, I'd like to tell you the tale\nof one of my favorite projects. I think it's one of the most exciting\nthat I'm working on, but I think it's also the simplest. It's a project that has the potential\nto make a huge impact around the world. It addresses one of the biggest\nhealth issues on the planet, the number one cause of death\nin children under five. Which is ...? Water-borne diseases?\nDiarrhea? Malnutrition? No. It's breathing the smoke\nfrom indoor cooking fires -- acute respiratory infections\ncaused by this. Can you believe that? I find this shocking\nand somewhat appalling. Can't we make\ncleaner burning cooking fuels? Can't we make better stoves? How is it that this can lead\nto over two million deaths every year? I know Bill Joy was talking to you\nabout the wonders of carbon nanotubes, so I'm going to talk to you\nabout the wonders of carbon macro-tubes, which is charcoal. (Laughter) So this is a picture of rural Haiti. Haiti is now 98 percent deforested. You'll see scenes like this\nall over the island. It leads to all sorts\nof environmental problems and problems that affect people\nthroughout the nation. A couple years ago\nthere was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths -- that's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills\nto stabilize the soil. So the rains come -- they go down the rivers\nand the flooding happens. Now one of the reasons\nwhy there are so few trees is this: people need to cook, and they harvest wood\nand they make charcoal in order to do it. It's not that people are ignorant\nto the environmental damage. They know perfectly well,\nbut they have no other choice. Fossil fuels are not available, and solar energy doesn't cook the way\nthat they like their food prepared. And so this is what they do. You'll find families like this who go out\ninto the forest to find a tree, cut it down and make charcoal out of it. So not surprisingly, there's a lot of effort that's been done\nto look at alternative cooking fuels. About four years ago, I took\na team of students down to Haiti and we worked with\nPeace Corps volunteers there. This is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built\nin the village where he worked. And the idea was\nthat you could take waste paper; you could compress it and make briquettes\nthat could be used for fuel. But this device was very slow. So our engineering students\nwent to work on it and with some very simple changes, they were able to triple\nthe throughput of this device. So you could imagine\nthey were very excited about it. And they took the briquettes back to MIT\nso that they could test them. And one of the things\nthat they found was they didn't burn. So it was a little\ndiscouraging to the students. (Laughter) And in fact, if you look closely, right here you can see\nit says, \"US Peace Corps.\" As it turns out, there actually wasn't\nany waste paper in this village. And while it was a good use\nof government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it\nback with him to his village, it was 800 kilometers away. And so we thought perhaps\nthere might be a better way to come up with\nan alternative cooking fuel. What we wanted to do\nis we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was\nreadily available on the local level. You see these all over Haiti as well. They're small-scale sugar mills. And the waste product from them after you extract the juice\nfrom the sugarcane is called \"bagasse.\" It has no other use. It has no nutritional value,\nso they don't feed it to the animals. It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill\nuntil eventually they burn it. What we wanted to do was\nwe wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource\nand turn it into a fuel that would be something\nthat people could easily cook with, something like charcoal. So over the next couple of years, students and I worked\nto develop a process. So you start with the bagasse,\nand then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of\na waste fifty five-gallon oil drum. After some time, after setting it on fire, you seal it to restrict the oxygen\nthat goes into the kiln, and then you end up\nwith this carbonized material here. However, you can't burn this. It's too fine and it burns too quickly\nto be useful for cooking. So we had to try to find a way\nto form it into useful briquettes. And conveniently,\none of my students was from Ghana, and he remembered a dish his mom\nused to make for him called \"kokonte,\" which is a very sticky porridge\nmade out of the cassava root. And so what we did was we looked, and we found that cassava\nis indeed grown in Haiti, under the name of \"manioc.\" In fact, it's grown all over the world -- yucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava,\nit's all the same thing -- a very starchy root vegetable. And you can make a very thick,\nsticky porridge out of it, which you can use to bind together\nthe charcoal briquettes. So we did this. We went down to Haiti. These are the graduates\nof the first Ecole de Charbon, or Charcoal Institute. And these -- (Laughter) That's right. So I'm actually\nan instructor at MIT as well as CIT. And these are the briquettes that we made. Now I'm going to take you\nto a different continent. This is India and this is the most commonly used\ncooking fuel in India. It's cow dung. And more than in Haiti,\nthis produces really smoky fires, and this is where you see\nthe health impacts of cooking with cow dung\nand biomass as a fuel. Kids and women\nare especially affected by it, because they're the ones\nwho are around the cooking fires. So we wanted to see if we could introduce\nthis charcoal-making technology there. Well, unfortunately,\nthey didn't have sugarcane and they didn't have cassava, but that didn't stop us. What we did was we found what were\nthe locally available sources of biomass. And there was wheat straw\nand there was rice straw in this area. And what we could use as a binder\nwas actually small amounts of cow manure, which they used ordinarily for their fuel. And we did side-by-side tests, and here you can see\nthe charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung. And you can see that it's a lot cleaner\nburning of a cooking fuel. And in fact, it heats the water\na lot more quickly. And so we were very happy, thus far. But one of the things that we found was when we did side-by-side\ncomparisons with wood charcoal, it didn't burn as long. And the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart\nas they were cooking. So we wanted to try to find a way\nto make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with\nwood charcoal in the markets in Haiti. So we went back to MIT, we took out the Instron machine and we figured out\nwhat sort of forces you needed in order to compress\na briquette to the level that you actually are getting\nimproved performance out of it? And at the same time that we had\nstudents in the lab looking at this, we also had community partners in Haiti\nworking to develop the process, to improve it and make it more accessible\nto people in the villages there. And after some time, we developed a low-cost press\nthat allows you to produce charcoal, which actually now burns not only -- actually, it burns longer,\ncleaner than wood charcoal. So now we're in a situation\nwhere we have a product, which is actually better than what\nyou can buy in Haiti in the marketplace, which is a very wonderful place to be. In Haiti alone, about 30 million trees\nare cut down every year. There's a possibility\nof this being implemented and saving a good portion of those. In addition, the revenue generated\nfrom that charcoal is 260 million dollars. That's an awful lot\nfor a country like Haiti -- with a population of eight million and an average income\nof less than 400 dollars. So this is where we're also moving ahead\nwith our charcoal project. And one of the things\nthat I think is also interesting, is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley\nwho's been doing risk analysis. And he's looked at the problem\nof the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal. And he's found that worldwide,\nyou could prevent a million deaths switching from wood\nto charcoal as a cooking fuel. That's remarkable, but up until now, there weren't ways\nto do it without cutting down trees. But now we have a way that's using an agricultural\nwaste material to create a cooking fuel. One of the really exciting things, though, is something that came out of the trip\nthat I took to Ghana just last month. And I think it's the coolest thing, and it's even lower tech\nthan what you just saw, if you can imagine such a thing. Here it is. So what is this? This is corncobs turned into charcoal. And the beauty of this is\nthat you don't need to form briquettes -- it comes ready made. This is my $100 laptop, right here. And actually, like Nick,\nI brought samples. (Laughter) So we can pass these around. They're fully functional,\nfield-tested, ready to roll out. (Laughter) And I think one of the things which is also remarkable\nabout this technology, is that the technology\ntransfer is so easy. Compared to the sugarcane charcoal, where we have to teach people\nhow to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step\nof cooking the binder, this comes pre-briquetted. And this is about the most exciting\nthing in my life right now, which is perhaps\na sad commentary on my life. (Laughter) But once you see it,\nlike you guys in the front row -- All right, yeah, OK. So anyway -- (Laughter) Here it is. And this is, I think, a perfect example of what Robert Wright was talking about\nin those non-zero-sum things. So not only do you have health benefits, you have environmental benefits. But this is one\nof the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits. People can make their own cooking fuel\nfrom waste products. They can generate income from this. They can save the money\nthat they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess\nand sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own. It's really rare\nthat you don't have trade-offs between health and economics,\nor environment and economics. So this is a project\nthat I just find extremely exciting and I'm really looking forward\nto see where it takes us. So when we talk about, now,\nthe future we will create, one of the things\nthat I think is necessary is to have a very clear vision\nof the world that we live in. And now, I don't actually mean\nthe world that we live in. I mean the world where women\nspend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat. I mean the world\nwhere advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles\nthat are made by hand, and where, when you work 10 hours a day, you're still only earning\n60 dollars in a month. I mean the world where women and children spend\n40 billion hours a year fetching water. That's as if the entire workforce\nof the state of California worked full time for a year\ndoing nothing but fetching water. It's a place where,\nfor example, if this were India, in this room, only three of us\nwould have a car. If this were Afghanistan, only one person in this room\nwould know how the use the Internet. If this were Zambia -- 300 of you would be farmers, 100 of you would have AIDS or HIV. And more than half of you would be living\non less than a dollar a day. These are the issues that we\nneed to come up with solutions for. These are the issues that\nwe need to be training our engineers, our designers, our business people,\nour entrepreneurs to be facing. These are the solutions\nthat we need to find. I have a few areas that I believe\nare especially important that we address. One of them is creating technologies to promote micro-finance\nand micro-enterprise, so that people who are living\nbelow the poverty line can find a way to move out -- and that they're not doing it using the same traditional\nbasket making, poultry rearing, etc. But there are new technologies\nand new products that they can make on a small scale. The next thing I believe is that we need to create\ntechnologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops. And we need to rethink\nour development strategies, so that we're not promoting\neducational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers, but rather to stop being poor farmers. And we need to think\nabout how we can do that effectively. We need to work with the people\nin these communities and give them the resources\nand the tools that they need to solve their own problems. That's the best way to do it. We shouldn't be doing it from outside. So we need to create this future,\nand we need to start doing it now. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you, incredible. Stay here. Tell us -- just while we see\nif someone has a question -- just tell us about one of the other things\nthat you've worked on. Amy Smith: Some of the other\nthings we're working on are ways to do low-cost\nwater quality testing, so that communities can maintain\ntheir own water systems, know when they're working,\nknow when they treat them, etc. We're also looking at low-cost\nwater-treatment systems. One of the really exciting things\nis looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability\nto be able to do that. CA: What's the bottleneck\npreventing this stuff getting from scale? Do you need to find entrepreneurs,\nor venture capitalists, or what do you need to take\nwhat you've got and get it to scale? AS: I think it's large numbers\nof people moving it forward. It's a difficult thing -- it's a marketplace\nwhich is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income. So you can't use the same models\nthat you use in the United States for making things move forward. And we're a pretty small staff, which is me. (Laughter) So, you know,\nI do what I can with the students. We have 30 students a year\ngo out into the field and try to implement this\nand move it forward. The other thing is you have to do things\nwith a long time frame, as, you know, you can't expect to get\nsomething done in a year or two years; you have to be looking\nfive or 10 years ahead. But I think with the vision to do that,\nwe can move forward."

        "transcript": "Charles Van Doren, who was later\na senior editor of Britannica, said the ideal encyclopedia\nshould be radical -- it should stop being safe. But if you know anything about the history\nof Britannica since 1962, it was anything but radical: still a very completely safe,\nstodgy type of encyclopedia. Wikipedia, on the other hand,\nbegins with a very radical idea, and that's for all of us\nto imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access\nto the sum of all human knowledge. And that's what we're doing. So Wikipedia -- you just saw the little\ndemonstration of it -- it's a freely licensed encyclopedia. It's written by thousands of volunteers all over the world\nin many, many languages. It's written using wiki software -- which is the type of software\nhe just demonstrated -- so anyone can quickly edit and save, and it goes live\non the Internet immediately. And everything about Wikipedia is managed\nby virtually an all-volunteer staff. So when Yochai is talking\nabout new methods of organization, he's exactly describing Wikipedia. And what I'm going to do today is tell you a little bit more\nabout how it really works on the inside. So Wikipedia's owned\nby the Wikimedia Foundation, which I founded, a nonprofit organization. And our goal, the core aim\nof the Wikimedia Foundation, is to get a free encyclopedia\nto every single person on the planet. And so, if you think\nabout what that means, it means a lot more\nthan just building a cool website. We're really interested\nin all the issues of the digital divide, poverty worldwide, empowering people everywhere\nto have the information that they need to make good decisions. And so we're going\nto have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the Internet. And so that's a big part of why\nwe've chosen the free licensing model, because that empowers local\nentrepreneurs or anyone who wants to -- they can take our content\nand do anything they like with it -- you can copy it, redistribute it -- and you can do it\ncommercially or non-commercially. So there's a lot of opportunities\nthat are going to arise around Wikipedia all over the world. We're funded by donations from the public, and one of the more\ninteresting things about that is how little money\nit actually takes to run Wikipedia. So Yochai showed you the graph\nof what the cost of a printing press was. And I'm going to tell you\nwhat the cost of Wikipedia is. But first, I'll show you how big it is. So we've got over 600,000\narticles in English. We've got two million total articles\nacross many, many different languages. The biggest languages\nare German, Japanese, French -- all the Western-European\nlanguages are quite big. But only around one-third\nof all of our traffic to our web clusters to the English Wikipedia, which is surprising to a lot of people. A lot of people think in a very\nEnglish-centric way on the Internet, but for us, we're truly global. We're in many, many languages. How popular we've gotten to be --\nwe're a top-50 website and we're more popular\nthan the New York Times. So this is where we get\nto Yochai's discussion. This shows the growth of Wikipedia --\nwe're the blue line there -- and this is the New York Times over there. And what's interesting about this is the New York Times website is a huge,\nenormous corporate operation with I have no idea\nhow many hundreds of employees. We have exactly one employee, and that employee\nis our lead software developer. And he's only been our employee\nsince January 2005, all the other growth before that ... So the servers are managed\nby a ragtag band of volunteers. All the editing is done by volunteers. And the way that we're organized is not like any traditional\norganization you can imagine. People are always asking,\n\"Well, who's in charge of this?\" or \"Who does that?\" And the answer is:\nanybody who wants to pitch in. It's a very unusual and chaotic thing. We've got over 90 servers now\nin three locations. These are managed by volunteer\nsystem administrators who are online. I can go online\nany time of the day or night and see eight to 10 people waiting for me to ask a question or something,\nanything about the servers. You could never afford\nto do this in a company. You could never afford to have a standby crew of people\n24 hours a day and do what we're doing at Wikipedia. So we're doing around\n1.4 billion page views monthly, so it's really gotten to be a huge thing. And everything is managed\nby the volunteers. And the total monthly cost\nfor our bandwidth is about 5,000 dollars. And that's essentially our main cost. We could actually do without the employee. We hired Brian because he was\nworking part-time for two years and full-time at Wikipedia, so we actually hired him, so he could get a life\nand go to the movies sometimes. So the big question when you've got\nthis really chaotic organization is, why isn't it all rubbish? Why is the website as good as it is? First of all, how good is it? Well, it's pretty good. It isn't perfect, but it's much better\nthan you would expect, given our completely chaotic model. So when you saw him make\na ridiculous edit to the page about me, you think, \"Oh, this is obviously\njust going to degenerate into rubbish.\" But when we've seen quality tests -- and there haven't been enough of these yet and I'm really encouraging\npeople to do more, comparing Wikipedia\nto traditional things -- we win hands down. So a German magazine\ncompared German Wikipedia, which is much, much smaller than English, to Microsoft Encarta\nand to Brockhaus multimedial, and we won across the board. They hired experts to come and look\nat articles and compare the quality, and we were very pleased with that result. So a lot of people have heard about\nthe Wikipedia Bush-Kerry controversy. The media has covered this\nsomewhat extensively. It started out\nwith an article in Red Herring. The reporters called me up and they -- I mean, I have to say\nthey spelled my name right, but they really wanted to say\nthe Bush-Kerry election is so contentious, it's tearing apart\nthe Wikipedia community. And so they quote me as saying, \"They're the most contentious\nin the history of Wikipedia.\" What I actually said\nis they're not contentious at all. So it's a slight misquote. (Laughter) The articles were edited quite heavily. And it is true that we did\nhave to lock the articles on a couple of occasions. Time magazine recently reported that \"Extreme action sometimes has to be taken, and Wales locked the entries\non Kerry and Bush for most of 2004.\" This came after I told the reporter\nthat we had to lock it for -- occasionally a little bit here and there. So the truth in general\nis that the kinds of controversies that you would probably think\nwe have within the Wikipedia community are not really controversies at all. Articles on controversial topics\nare edited a lot, but they don't cause much controversy\nwithin the community. And the reason for this is that most\npeople understand the need for neutrality. The real struggle is not\nbetween the right and the left -- that's where most people assume -- but it's between\nthe party of the thoughtful and the party of the jerks. And no side of the political spectrum has a monopoly\non either of those qualities. The actual truth\nabout the specific Bush-Kerry incident is that the Bush-Kerry articles were locked less than one percent\nof the time in 2004, and it wasn't because\nthey were contentious; it was just because\nthere was routine vandalism -- which happens sometimes even on stage ... (Laughter) Sometimes even reporters have reported\nto me that they vandalized Wikipedia and were amazed\nthat it was fixed so quickly. And I said -- you know, I always say,\nplease don't do that. That's not a good thing. So how do we do this? How do we manage the quality control? How does it work? So there's a few elements, mostly social policies\nand some elements of the software. So the biggest\nand the most important thing is our neutral point of view policy. This is something\nthat I set down, from the very beginning, as a core principle of the community\nthat's completely not debatable. It's a social concept of cooperation, so we don't talk a lot\nabout truth and objectivity. The reason for this is if we say we're only going to write\nthe \"truth\" about some topic, that doesn't do us a damn bit of good\nof figuring out what to write, because I don't agree with you\nabout what's the truth. But we have this\njargon term of neutrality, which has its own long history\nwithin the community, which basically says,\nany time there's a controversial issue, Wikipedia itself should not\ntake a stand on the issue. We should merely report on what\nreputable parties have said about it. So this neutrality policy\nis really important for us because it empowers a community\nthat is very diverse to come together\nand actually get some work done. So we have very diverse contributors in terms of political,\nreligious, cultural backgrounds. By having this firm neutrality policy, which is non-negotiable\nfrom the beginning, we ensure that people can work together and that the entries\ndon't become simply a war back and forth\nbetween the left and the right. If you engage in that type of behavior,\nyou'll be asked to leave the community. So, real-time peer review. Every single change on the site\ngoes to the \"Recent changes\" page. So as soon as he made his change,\nit went to the \"Recent changes\" page. That recent changes page\nwas also fed into an IRC channel, which is an Internet chat channel that people are monitoring\nwith various software tools. And people can get RSS feeds -- they can get email\nnotifications of changes. And then users can set up\ntheir own personal watch list. So my page is on quite a few\nvolunteers' watch lists, because it is sometimes vandalized. And therefore, what happens is someone\nwill notice the change very quickly, and then they'll just\nsimply revert the change. There's a \"new pages feed,\" for example, so you can go\nto a certain page of Wikipedia and see every new page as it's created. This is really important because a lot of new pages\nare just garbage that has to be deleted, you know, \"ASDFASDF.\" But also, that's some\nof the most interesting and fun things, some of the new articles. People will start an article\non some interesting topic, other people will find that intriguing and jump in and help\nand make it much better. So we do have edits by anonymous users, which is one of the most controversial\nand intriguing things about Wikipedia. So, Chris was able to do his change --\nhe didn't have to log in or anything; he just went on the website\nand made a change. But it turns out\nthat only about 18 percent of all the edits to the website are done by anonymous users. And that's a really important\nthing to understand: the vast majority of the edits\nthat go on on the website are from a very close-knit community\nof maybe 600 to 1,000 people who are in constant communication. And we have over 40 IRC channels,\n40 mailing lists. All these people know each other. They communicate.\nWe have off-line meetings. These are the people\nwho are doing the bulk of the site, and they are, in a sense,\nsemi-professionals at what they're doing. The standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher\nthan professional standards of quality. We don't always meet those standards,\nbut that's what we're striving for. And so that tight community\nis who really cares for the site, and these are some\nof the smartest people I've ever met. It's my job to say that,\nbut it's actually true. The type of people who were drawn\nto writing an encyclopedia for fun tend to be pretty smart people. The tools and the software:\nthere's lots of tools that allow us -- allow us, meaning the community -- to self-monitor\nand to monitor all the work. This is an example\nof a page history on \"flat Earth,\" and you can see some changes\nthat were made. What's nice about this page\nis you can immediately take a look at this and see, \"OK, I understand now.\" When somebody goes and looks at -- they see that someone,\nan anonymous IP number, made an edit to my page. That sounds suspicious.\nWho is this person? Somebody looks at it -- they can immediately see\nhighlighted in red all of the changes that took place -- to see, OK, well, these words\nhave changed, things like this. So that's one tool that we can use to very quickly monitor\nthe history of a page. Another thing that we do\nwithin the community is we leave everything very open-ended. Most of the social rules\nand the methods of work are left completely open-ended\nin the software. All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages. And so there's nothing\nin the software that enforces the rules. The example I've got up here\nis the Votes for Deletion page. So, I mentioned earlier,\npeople type \"ASDFASDF\" -- it needs to be deleted. Cases like that,\nthe administrators just delete it. There's no reason\nto have a big argument about it. But you can imagine there's a lot\nof other areas where the question is, is this notable enough\nto go in an encyclopedia? Is the information verifiable?\nIs it a hoax? Is it true? Is it what? So we needed a social method\nfor figuring out the answer to this. And so the method that arose\norganically within the community is the Votes For Deletion page. And in the particular\nexample we have here, it's a film, \"Twisted Issues,\" and the first person says, \"Now this is supposedly a film.\nIt fails the Google test miserably.\" The Google test is you look in Google\nand see if it's there, because if something's not even in Google,\nit probably doesn't exist at all. It's not a perfect rule, but it's a nice starting point\nfor quick research. So somebody says, \"Delete it, please.\nDelete it -- it's not notable.\" And then somebody says,\n\"Wait, I found it. I found it in a book, 'Film Threat Video Guide:\nthe 20 Underground Films You Must See.'\" So the next persons says, \"Clean it up.\" Somebody says, \"I've found it on IMDB.\nKeep, keep, keep.\" And what's interesting about this\nis that the software is -- these votes are just text\ntyped into a page. This is not really a vote\nso much as it is a dialogue. Now it is true that at the end of the day, an administrator can go through here\nand take a look at this and say, \"OK, 18 deletes, two keeps:\nwe'll delete it.\" But in other cases,\nthis could be 18 deletes and two keeps, and we would keep it,\nbecause if those last two keeps say, \"Wait a minute. Nobody else saw this\nbut I found it in a book, and I found a link\nto a page that describes it, and I'm going to clean it up tomorrow,\nso please don't delete it,\" then it would survive. And it also matters\nwho the people are who are voting. Like I say, it's a tight-knit community. Down here at the bottom,\n\"Keep, real movie,\" RickK. RickK is a very famous Wikipedian\nwho does an enormous amount of work with vandalism, hoaxes\nand votes for deletion. His voice carries a lot of weight\nwithin the community because he knows what he's doing. So how is all this governed? People really want to know\nabout administrators, things like that. So the Wikipedia governance model,\nthe governance of the community, is a very confusing,\nbut workable mix of consensus -- meaning we try not to vote\non the content of articles, because the majority view\nis not necessarily neutral -- some amount of democracy -- all of the administrators -- these are the people\nwho have the ability to delete pages. That doesn't mean that they have\nthe right to delete pages. They still have to follow all the rules --\nbut they're elected by the community. Sometimes people --\nrandom trolls on the Internet -- like to accuse me\nof handpicking the administrators to bias the content of the encyclopedia. I always laugh at this, because I have\nno idea how they're elected, actually. There's a certain amount of aristocracy. You got a hint of that\nwhen I mentioned, like, RickK's voice would carry\na lot more weight than someone we don't know. I give this talk sometimes with Angela, who was just re-elected to the board\nfrom the community -- to the Board of the Foundation, with more than twice the votes\nof the person who didn't make it. And I always embarrass her because I say, \"Well, Angela, for example, could get away with doing\nabsolutely anything within Wikipedia, because she's so admired and so powerful.\" But the irony is, of course, that Angela\ncan do this because she's the one person who you know would never, ever\nbreak any rules of Wikipedia. And I also like to say\nshe's the only person who actually knows\nall the rules of Wikipedia, so ... And then there's monarchy, and that's my role\non the community, so ... (Laughter) I was describing this in Berlin once, and the next day\nin the newspaper the headline said, \"I am the Queen of England.\" (Laughter) And that's not exactly what I said, but -- (Laughter) the point is my role in the community -- Within the free software world,\nthere's been a long-standing tradition of the \"benevolent dictator\" model. So if you look at most\nof the major free software projects, they have one single person in charge who everyone agrees\nis the benevolent dictator. Well, I don't like the term\n\"benevolent dictator,\" and I don't think that it's my job\nor my role in the world of ideas to be the dictator of the future\nof all human knowledge compiled by the world. It just isn't appropriate. But there is a need still\nfor a certain amount of monarchy, a certain amount of -- sometimes we have to make a decision and we don't want\nto get bogged down too heavily in formal decision-making processes. So as an example\nof how this can be important: we recently had a situation where\na neo-Nazi website discovered Wikipedia, and they said,\n\"Oh, well, this is horrible, this Jewish conspiracy of a website, and we're going to get certain articles\ndeleted that we don't like. And we see they have a voting process,\nso we're going to send -- we have 40,000 members\nand we're going to send them over and they're all going to vote\nand get these pages deleted.\" Well, they managed\nto get 18 people to show up. That's neo-Nazi math for you. They always think they've got\n40,000 members when they've got 18. But they managed to get 18 people\nto come and vote in a fairly absurd way to delete a perfectly valid article. Of course, the vote ended up\nbeing about 85 to 18, so there was no real danger\nto our democratic processes. On the other hand, people said,\n\"But what are we going to do? I mean, this could happen. What if some group\ngets really seriously organized and comes in and wants to vote?\" Then I said, \"Well, fuck it,\nwe'll just change the rules.\" That's my job in the community: to say we won't allow\nour openness and freedom to undermine the quality of the content. And so, as long as people\ntrust me in my role, then that's a valid place for me. Of course, because of the free licensing, if I do a bad job, the volunteers\nare more than happy to take and leave -- I can't tell anyone what to do. So the final point here\nis that to understand how Wikipedia works, it's important to understand\nthat our wiki model is the way we work, but we are not fanatical web anarchists. In fact, we're very flexible\nabout the social methodology, because ultimately,\nthe passion of the community is for the quality of the work, not necessarily for the process\nthat we use to generate it. Thank you. (Applause) Ben Saunders: Yeah, hi, Ben Saunders. Jimmy, you mentioned impartiality\nbeing a key to Wikipedia's success. It strikes me that much of the textbooks\nthat are used to educate our children are inherently biased. Have you found Wikipedia\nbeing used by teachers and how do you see Wikipedia\nchanging education? Jimmy Wales: Yeah, so, a lot of teachers\nare beginning to use Wikipedia. There's a media storyline about Wikipedia,\nwhich I think is false. It builds on the storyline\nof bloggers versus newspapers. And the storyline is,\nthere's this crazy thing, Wikipedia, but academics hate it\nand teachers hate it. And that turns out to not be true. The last time I got an email\nfrom a journalist saying, \"Why do academics hate Wikipedia?\" I sent it from my Harvard email address because I was recently\nappointed a fellow there. And I said, \"Well,\nthey don't all hate it.\" (Laughter) But I think there's going\nto be huge impacts. And we actually have a project\nthat I'm personally really excited about, which is the Wikibooks project, which is an effort to create\ntextbooks in all the languages. And that's a much bigger project. It's going to take 20 years or so\nto come to fruition. But part of that is to fulfill our mission of giving an encyclopedia\nto every single person on the planet. We don't mean we're going\nto Spam them with AOL-style CDs. We mean we're going to give them\na tool that they can use. And for a lot of people in the world, if I give you an encyclopedia\nthat's written at a university level, it doesn't do you any good\nwithout a whole host of literacy materials to build you up to the point\nwhere you can actually use it. The Wikibooks project\nis an effort to do that. And I think that we're going to see --\nit may not even come from us; there's all kinds of innovation going on. But freely licensed textbooks\nare the next big thing in education."

        "transcript": "Good morning. How are you? (Audience) Good. It's been great, hasn't it? I've been blown away by the whole thing. In fact, I'm leaving. (Laughter) There have been three themes\nrunning through the conference, which are relevant\nto what I want to talk about. One is the extraordinary\nevidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here; just the variety of it\nand the range of it. The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea\nwhat's going to happen in terms of the future. No idea how this may play out. I have an interest in education. Actually, what I find is,\neverybody has an interest in education. Don't you? I find this very interesting. If you're at a dinner party,\nand you say you work in education -- actually, you're not often\nat dinner parties, frankly. (Laughter) If you work in education,\nyou're not asked. (Laughter) And you're never asked back, curiously.\nThat's strange to me. But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, \"What do you do?\" and you say you work in education, you can see the blood run from their face. They're like, \"Oh my God. Why me?\" (Laughter) \"My one night out all week.\" (Laughter) But if you ask about their education,\nthey pin you to the wall, because it's one of those things\nthat goes deep with people, am I right? Like religion and money and other things. So I have a big interest in education,\nand I think we all do. We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it's education\nthat's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. If you think of it, children starting school this year\nwill be retiring in 2065. Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that's been\non parade for the past four days, what the world will look like\nin five years' time. And yet, we're meant\nto be educating them for it. So the unpredictability,\nI think, is extraordinary. And the third part of this\nis that we've all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary\ncapacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation. I mean, Sirena last night\nwas a marvel, wasn't she? Just seeing what she could do. And she's exceptional, but I think\nshe's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood. What you have there is a person\nof extraordinary dedication who found a talent. And my contention is,\nall kids have tremendous talents, and we squander them, pretty ruthlessly. So I want to talk about education, and I want to talk about creativity. My contention is that creativity now\nis as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it\nwith the same status. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) That was it, by the way.\nThank you very much. (Laughter) So, 15 minutes left. (Laughter) \"Well, I was born ... \" (Laughter) I heard a great story recently --\nI love telling it -- of a little girl\nwho was in a drawing lesson. She was six, and she was\nat the back, drawing, and the teacher said this girl\nhardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did. The teacher was fascinated. She went over to her,\nand she said, \"What are you drawing?\" And the girl said,\n\"I'm drawing a picture of God.\" And the teacher said, \"But nobody\nknows what God looks like.\" And the girl said,\n\"They will in a minute.\" (Laughter) When my son was four in England -- actually, he was four\neverywhere, to be honest. (Laughter) If we're being strict about it,\nwherever he went, he was four that year. He was in the Nativity play.\nDo you remember the story? (Laughter) No, it was big, it was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel,\nyou may have seen it. (Laughter) \"Nativity II.\" But James got the part of Joseph,\nwhich we were thrilled about. We considered this to be\none of the lead parts. We had the place crammed\nfull of agents in T-shirts: \"James Robinson IS Joseph!\" (Laughter) He didn't have to speak, but you know\nthe bit where the three kings come in? They come in bearing gifts,\ngold, frankincense and myrrh. This really happened. We were sitting there, and I think\nthey just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy\nafterward and said, \"You OK with that?\" They said,\n\"Yeah, why? Was that wrong?\" They just switched. The three boys came in, four-year-olds\nwith tea towels on their heads. They put these boxes down, and the first\nboy said, \"I bring you gold.\" And the second boy said,\n\"I bring you myrrh.\" And the third boy said, \"Frank sent this.\" (Laughter) What these things have in common\nis that kids will take a chance. If they don't know, they'll have a go. Am I right? They're not\nfrightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong\nis the same thing as being creative. What we do know is,\nif you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up\nwith anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults,\nmost kids have lost that capacity. They have become\nfrightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running\nnational education systems where mistakes are the worst\nthing you can make. And the result is that\nwe are educating people out of their creative capacities. Picasso once said this, he said\nthat all children are born artists. The problem is to remain\nan artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately,\nthat we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out of it. So why is this? I lived in Stratford-on-Avon\nuntil about five years ago. In fact, we moved from Stratford\nto Los Angeles. So you can imagine\nwhat a seamless transition this was. (Laughter) Actually, we lived in a place\ncalled Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where\nShakespeare's father was born. Are you struck by a new thought? I was. You don't think of Shakespeare\nhaving a father, do you? Do you? Because you don't think\nof Shakespeare being a child, do you? Shakespeare being seven? I never thought of it. I mean, he was seven at some point. He was in somebody's\nEnglish class, wasn't he? (Laughter) How annoying would that be? (Laughter) \"Must try harder.\" (Laughter) Being sent to bed by his dad,\nto Shakespeare, \"Go to bed, now!\" To William Shakespeare. \"And put the pencil down!\" (Laughter) \"And stop speaking like that.\" (Laughter) \"It's confusing everybody.\" (Laughter) Anyway, we moved\nfrom Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word\nabout the transition. Actually, my son didn't want to come. I've got two kids;\nhe's 21 now, my daughter's 16. He didn't want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it, but he had\na girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life, Sarah. He'd known her for a month. (Laughter) Mind you, they'd had\ntheir fourth anniversary, because it's a long time when you're 16. He was really upset on the plane. He said, \"I'll never find\nanother girl like Sarah.\" And we were rather pleased\nabout that, frankly -- (Laughter) because she was the main reason\nwe were leaving the country. (Laughter) But something strikes you\nwhen you move to America and travel around the world: every education system on earth\nhas the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. Doesn't matter where you go. You'd think it would be\notherwise, but it isn't. At the top are mathematics and languages,\nthen the humanities. At the bottom are the arts.\nEverywhere on earth. And in pretty much every system, too,\nthere's a hierarchy within the arts. Art and music are normally given\na higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an education\nsystem on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why? Why not? I think this is rather important. I think math is very important,\nbut so is dance. Children dance all the time\nif they're allowed to, we all do. We all have bodies, don't we?\nDid I miss a meeting? (Laughter) Truthfully, what happens is,\nas children grow up, we start to educate them progressively\nfrom the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side. If you were to visit education as an alien and say \"What's it for, public education?\" I think you'd have to conclude,\nif you look at the output, who really succeeds by this, who does everything they should, who gets all the brownie points,\nwho are the winners -- I think you'd have to conclude\nthe whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors. Isn't it? They're the people who come out the top. And I used to be one, so there. (Laughter) And I like university professors, but, you know, we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark\nof all human achievement. They're just a form of life. Another form of life. But they're rather curious. And I say this out of affection for them: there's something curious\nabout professors. In my experience -- not all of them,\nbut typically -- they live in their heads. They live up there\nand slightly to one side. They're disembodied, you know,\nin a kind of literal way. They look upon their body as a form\nof transport for their heads. (Laughter) Don't they? It's a way of getting\ntheir head to meetings. (Laughter) If you want real evidence\nof out-of-body experiences, by the way, get yourself along to a residential\nconference of senior academics and pop into the discotheque\non the final night. (Laughter) And there, you will see it. Grown men and women\nwrithing uncontrollably, off the beat. (Laughter) Waiting until it ends, so they can\ngo home and write a paper about it. (Laughter) Our education system is predicated\non the idea of academic ability. And there's a reason. Around the world, there were\nno public systems of education, really, before the 19th century. They all came into being\nto meet the needs of industrialism. So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas. Number one, that the most useful\nsubjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away\nfrom things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds you would never\nget a job doing that. Is that right? \"Don't do music, you're not\ngoing to be a musician; don't do art, you won't be an artist.\" Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken. The whole world\nis engulfed in a revolution. And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate\nour view of intelligence, because the universities design\nthe system in their image. If you think of it, the whole system of public education\naround the world is a protracted process of university entrance. And the consequence is\nthat many highly talented, brilliant, creative people\nthink they're not, because the thing\nthey were good at at school wasn't valued,\nor was actually stigmatized. And I think we can't afford\nto go on that way. In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be\ngraduating through education than since the beginning of history. More people. And it's the combination\nof all the things we've talked about: technology and its\ntransformational effect on work, and demography and the huge\nexplosion in population. Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. Isn't that true? When I was a student,\nif you had a degree, you had a job. If you didn't have a job,\nit's because you didn't want one. And I didn't want one, frankly. (Laughter) But now kids with degrees\nare often heading home to carry on playing video games, because you need an MA\nwhere the previous job required a BA, and now you need a PhD for the other. It's a process of academic inflation. And it indicates the whole structure\nof education is shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically rethink\nour view of intelligence. We know three things about intelligence. One, it's diverse. We think about the world in all the ways\nthat we experience it. We think visually, we think in sound,\nwe think kinesthetically. We think in abstract terms,\nwe think in movement. Secondly, intelligence is dynamic. If you look at the interactions\nof a human brain, as we heard yesterday\nfrom a number of presentations, intelligence is wonderfully interactive. The brain isn't divided into compartments. In fact, creativity -- which I define as the process of having\noriginal ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different\ndisciplinary ways of seeing things. By the way, there's a shaft of nerves\nthat joins the two halves of the brain, called the corpus callosum. It's thicker in women. Following off from Helen yesterday, this is probably why women\nare better at multitasking. Because you are, aren't you? There's a raft of research,\nbut I know it from my personal life. If my wife is cooking a meal\nat home, which is not often ... thankfully. (Laughter) No, she's good at some things. But if she's cooking,\nshe's dealing with people on the phone, she's talking to the kids,\nshe's painting the ceiling -- (Laughter) she's doing open-heart surgery over here. If I'm cooking, the door\nis shut, the kids are out, the phone's on the hook, if she comes in, I get annoyed. I say, \"Terry, please,\nI'm trying to fry an egg in here.\" (Laughter) \"Give me a break.\" (Laughter) Actually, do you know\nthat old philosophical thing, \"If a tree falls in a forest,\nand nobody hears it, did it happen?\" Remember that old chestnut? I saw a great T-shirt\nrecently, which said, \"If a man speaks his mind in a forest,\nand no woman hears him, is he still wrong?\" (Laughter) And the third thing about intelligence is, it's distinct. I'm doing a new book at the moment\ncalled \"Epiphany,\" which is based on a series\nof interviews with people about how they discovered their talent. I'm fascinated by\nhow people got to be there. It's really prompted by a conversation\nI had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people\nhave never heard of, Gillian Lynne. Have you heard of her? Some have. She's a choreographer,\nand everybody knows her work. She did \"Cats\" and \"Phantom of the Opera.\" She's wonderful. I used to be on the board\nof The Royal Ballet, as you can see. (Laughter) Gillian and I had lunch one day.\nI said, \"How did you get to be a dancer?\" It was interesting. When she was at school,\nshe was really hopeless. And the school, in the '30s,\nwrote to her parents and said, \"We think Gillian\nhas a learning disorder.\" She couldn't concentrate;\nshe was fidgeting. I think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you? But this was the 1930s, and ADHD\nhadn't been invented at this point. It wasn't an available condition. (Laughter) People weren't aware they could have that. (Laughter) Anyway, she went to see this specialist. So, this oak-paneled room,\nand she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat\non this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes, while this man talked to her mother about all the problems\nGillian was having at school, because she was disturbing people,\nher homework was always late, and so on. Little kid of eight. In the end, the doctor went\nand sat next to Gillian and said, \"I've listened to all these\nthings your mother's told me. I need to speak to her privately. Wait here. We'll be back.\nWe won't be very long,\" and they went and left her. But as they went out of the room, he turned on the radio\nthat was sitting on his desk. And when they got out of the room, he said to her mother,\n\"Just stand and watch her.\" And the minute they left the room, she was on her feet, moving to the music. And they watched for a few minutes,\nand he turned to her mother and said, \"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick. She's a dancer. Take her to a dance school.\" I said, \"What happened?\" She said, \"She did. I can't tell you\nhow wonderful it was. We walked in this room,\nand it was full of people like me -- people who couldn't sit still, people who had to move to think.\" Who had to move to think. They did ballet, they did tap, jazz;\nthey did modern; they did contemporary. She was eventually auditioned\nfor the Royal Ballet School. She became a soloist; she had\na wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated\nfrom the Royal Ballet School, founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company, met Andrew Lloyd Webber. She's been responsible for some of the most successful\nmusical theater productions in history, she's given pleasure to millions, and she's a multimillionaire. Somebody else might have put her\non medication and told her to calm down. (Applause) What I think it comes to is this: Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution\nthat was triggered by Rachel Carson. I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception\nof human ecology, one in which we start\nto reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth\nfor a particular commodity. And for the future, it won't serve us. We have to rethink\nthe fundamental principles on which we're educating our children. There was a wonderful quote\nby Jonas Salk, who said, \"If all the insects\nwere to disappear from the Earth, within 50 years,\nall life on Earth would end. If all human beings\ndisappeared from the Earth, within 50 years,\nall forms of life would flourish.\" And he's right. What TED celebrates is the gift\nof the human imagination. We have to be careful now\nthat we use this gift wisely, and that we avert some of the scenarios\nthat we've talked about. And the only way we'll do it\nis by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children\nfor the hope that they are. And our task is to educate\ntheir whole being, so they can face this future. By the way -- we may not see this future, but they will. And our job is to help them\nmake something of it. Thank you very much. (Applause)",

When we grow up, we become frightened for being wrong and in the school system, mistakes are the worst thing you can make. But isn't school supposed to prepare us for the future? The knowledge we gain from school matters but creativity is still necessary. Students spend 18+ years in their lives taking tests, memorizing informations and spent hours finishing homeworks. However, true learning is born out of lasting understanding, not grades and tests. The informations we memorize fades by the time, but our creativity won\u2019t. In school, even if you\u2019re allowed to be creative, they put a lot of restrictions in it. Students are expected to follow methods instead of creating their own. For example, in Literature. Students are often given strict guidelines for writing things like poems. School makes us create poems that have precise rules for each individual line, making poetry seem very constricted and uncreative. School drains out creativity of oneself.That\u2019s why school must focus on empowering students\u2019 creativity.": {

        "transcript": "If you're here today -- and I'm very happy that you are -- you've all heard about\nhow sustainable development will save us from ourselves. However, when we're not at TED,\nwe are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda\nis just not feasible, especially in large urban areas\nlike New York City. And that's because most people\nwith decision-making powers, in both the public and the private sector, really don't feel\nas though they're in danger. The reason why I'm here today,\nin part, is because of a dog -- an abandoned puppy I found\nback in the rain, back in 1998. She turned out to be\na much bigger dog than I'd anticipated. When she came into my life, we were\nfighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront despite the fact that\nour small part of New York City already handled more than 40 percent\nof the entire city's commercial waste: a sewage treatment pelletizing plant,\na sewage sludge plant, four power plants, the world's largest\nfood-distribution center, as well as other industries that bring\nmore than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week. The area also has one of the lowest ratios\nof parks to people in the city. So when I was contacted\nby the Parks Department about a $10,000 seed-grant initiative\nto help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were really\nwell-meaning, but a bit naive. I'd lived in this area all my life,\nand you could not get to the river, because of all the lovely facilities\nthat I mentioned earlier. Then, while jogging\nwith my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought\nwas just another illegal dump. There were weeds and piles of garbage\nand other stuff that I won't mention here, but she kept dragging me, and lo and behold, at the end\nof that lot was the river. I knew that this forgotten\nlittle street-end, abandoned like the dog that brought\nme there, was worth saving. And I knew it would grow\nto become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization\nof the new South Bronx. And just like my new dog, it was an idea\nthat got bigger than I'd imagined. We garnered much support along the way, and the Hunts Point Riverside Park\nbecame the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had\nin more than 60 years. We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant\nmore than 300 times, into a $3 million park. And in the fall, I'm going to exchange\nmarriage vows with my beloved. (Audience whistles) Thank you very much. (Applause) That's him pressing my buttons\nback there, which he does all the time. (Laughter) (Applause) But those of us living\nin environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine. We feel the problems right now,\nand have for some time. Environmental justice, for those of you\nwho may not be familiar with the term, goes something like this: no community should be saddled\nwith more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits\nthan any other. Unfortunately, race and class\nare extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff,\nlike parks and trees, and where one might find the bad stuff,\nlike power plants and waste facilities. As a black person in America,\nI am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution\nposes the greatest risk to my health. I am five times more likely\nto live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility, which I do. These land-use decisions\ncreated the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity,\ndiabetes and asthma. Why would someone leave their home to go\nfor a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood? Our 27 percent obesity rate\nis high even for this country, and diabetes comes with it. One out of four South Bronx\nchildren has asthma. Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher\nthan the national average. These impacts are coming everyone's way. And we all pay dearly\nfor solid waste costs, health problems associated\nwith pollution and more odiously, the cost of imprisoning\nour young black and Latino men, who possess untold amounts\nof untapped potential. Fifty percent of our residents\nlive at or below the poverty line; 25 percent of us are unemployed. Low-income citizens often use\nemergency-room visits as primary care. This comes at a high cost to taxpayers\nand produces no proportional benefits. Poor people are not only still poor,\nthey are still unhealthy. Fortunately, there are many people\nlike me who are striving for solutions that won't compromise the lives of low-income communities of color\nin the short term, and won't destroy us all in the long term. None of us want that,\nand we all have that in common. So what else do we have in common? Well, first of all,\nwe're all incredibly good-looking. (Laughter) Graduated high school, college,\npost-graduate degrees, traveled to interesting places,\ndidn't have kids in your early teens, financially stable, never been imprisoned. OK. Good. (Laughter) But, besides being a black woman, I am different from most of you\nin some other ways. I watched nearly half of the buildings\nin my neighborhood burn down. My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam, only to be gunned down\na few blocks from our home. Jesus. I grew up with a crack house\nacross the street. Yeah, I'm a poor black child\nfrom the ghetto. These things make me different from you. But the things we have in common set me apart from most\nof the people in my community, and I am in between these two worlds with enough of my heart\nto fight for justice in the other. So how did things get so different for us? In the late '40s, my dad --\na Pullman porter, son of a slave -- bought a house in the Hunts Point\nsection of the South Bronx, and a few years later, he married my mom. At the time, the community was a mostly\nwhite, working-class neighborhood. My dad was not alone. And as others like him pursued\ntheir own version of the American dream, white flight became common\nin the South Bronx and in many cities around the country. Red-lining was used by banks,\nwherein certain sections of the city, including ours, were deemed\noff-limits to any sort of investment. Many landlords believed it was more\nprofitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather\nthan to sell under those conditions -- dead or injured former tenants\nnotwithstanding. Hunts Point was formerly\na walk-to-work community, but now residents had neither\nwork nor home to walk to. A national highway construction boom\nwas added to our problems. In New York State, Robert Moses spearheaded\nan aggressive highway-expansion campaign. One of its primary goals was\nto make it easier for residents of wealthy communities\nin Westchester County to go to Manhattan. The South Bronx, which lies in between,\ndid not stand a chance. Residents were often given\nless than a month's notice before their buildings were razed. 600,000 people were displaced. The common perception was that only pimps and pushers\nand prostitutes were from the South Bronx. And if you are told\nfrom your earliest days that nothing good is going to come\nfrom your community, that it's bad and ugly, how could it not reflect on you? So now, my family's property\nwas worthless, save for that it was our home,\nand all we had. And luckily for me, that home\nand the love inside of it, along with help from teachers, mentors\nand friends along the way, was enough. Now, why is this story important? Because from a planning perspective, economic degradation\nbegets environmental degradation, which begets social degradation. The disinvestment that began\nin the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental\ninjustices that were to come. Antiquated zoning and land-use\nregulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting\nfacilities in my neighborhood. Are these factors taken into consideration\nwhen land-use policy is decided? What costs are associated\nwith these decisions? And who pays? Who profits? Does anything justify\nwhat the local community goes through? This was \"planning\" -- in quotes -- that did not have\nour best interests in mind. Once we realized that, we decided\nit was time to do our own planning. That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building\na Greenway movement in the South Bronx. I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million\ndollar federal transportation grant to design the plan\nfor a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on-street bike paths. Physical improvements help inform\npublic policy regarding traffic safety, the placement of the waste\nand other facilities, which, if done properly, don't compromise\na community's quality of life. They provide opportunities\nto be more physically active, as well as local economic development. Think bike shops, juice stands. We secured 20 million dollars\nto build first-phase projects. This is Lafayette Avenue -- and that's redesigned\nby Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects. And once this path is constructed,\nit'll connect the South Bronx with more than 400 acres\nof Randall's Island Park. Right now we're separated by about 25 feet\nof water, but this link will change that. As we nurture the natural environment,\nits abundance will give us back even more. We run a project called the Bronx\n[Environmental] Stewardship Training, which provides job training in the fields\nof ecological restoration, so that folks from our community\nhave the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs. Little by little, we're seeding\nthe area with green-collar jobs -- and with people that have both\na financial and personal stake in their environment. The Sheridan Expressway\nis an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era, built with no regard for the neighborhoods\nthat were divided by it. Even during rush hour,\nit goes virtually unused. The community created\nan alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal\nof the highway. We have the opportunity now to bring\ntogether all the stakeholders to re-envision how this 28 acres\ncan be better utilized for parkland, affordable housing\nand local economic development. We also built New York City's first green\nand cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices. Cool roofs are highly-reflective\nsurfaces that don't absorb solar heat, and pass it on to\nthe building or atmosphere. Green roofs are soil and living plants. Both can be used instead\nof petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat, contribute\nto urban \"heat island\" effect and degrade under the sun, which we in turn breathe. Green roofs also retain\nup to 75 percent of rainfall, so they reduce a city's need to fund\ncostly end-of-pipe solutions -- which, incidentally, are often located in environmental justice\ncommunities like mine. And they provide habitats\nfor our little friends! [Butterfly] (Laughter) So cool! Anyway, the demonstration\nproject is a springboard for our own green roof\ninstallation business, bringing jobs and sustainable\neconomic activity to the South Bronx. [Green is the new black ...] (Laughter) (Applause) I like that, too. Anyway, I know Chris told us\nnot to do pitches up here, but since I have all of your attention: We need investors. End of pitch. It's better to ask\nfor forgiveness than permission. Anyway -- (Laughter) (Applause) OK. Katrina. Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx\nand New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common. Both were largely populated\nby poor people of color, both hotbeds of cultural innovation:\nthink hip-hop and jazz. Both are waterfront communities\nthat host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another. In the post-Katrina era,\nwe have still more in common. We're at best ignored,\nand maligned and abused, at worst, by negligent regulatory agencies,\npernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability. Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward\nnor the South Bronx was inevitable. But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out. We are more than simply\nnational symbols of urban blight or problems to be solved\nby empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone. Now will we let the Gulf Coast\nlanguish for a decade or two, like the South Bronx did? Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource\nof grassroots activists that have been born of desperation\nin communities like mine? Now listen, I do not expect individuals, corporations or government\nto make the world a better place because it is right or moral. This presentation today only represents\nsome of what I've been through. Like a tiny little bit. You've no clue. But I'll tell you later,\nif you want to know. (Laughter) But -- I know it's the bottom line,\nor one's perception of it, that motivates people in the end. I'm interested in what I like to call\nthe \"triple bottom line\" that sustainable development can produce. Developments that have the potential\nto create positive returns for all concerned:\nthe developers, government and the community\nwhere these projects go up. At present, that's not happening\nin New York City. And we are operating with a comprehensive\nurban-planning deficit. A parade of government subsidies is going to propose big-box and stadium\ndevelopments in the South Bronx, but there is scant coordination\nbetween city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects\nof increased traffic, pollution, solid waste and the impacts on open space. And their approaches to local economic\nand job development are so lame it's not even funny. Because on top of that, the world's richest sports team\nis replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two\nwell-loved community parks. Now, we'll have even less\nthan that stat I told you about earlier. And although less than 25 percent\nof South Bronx residents own cars, these projects include\nthousands of new parking spaces, yet zip in terms of mass public transit. Now, what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy,\nenvironmentally-challenged community, versus incorporating structural,\nsustainable changes. My agency is working closely\nwith Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues. Now let's get this straight:\nI am not anti-development. Ours is a city, not a wilderness preserve. And I've embraced my inner capitalist. And, but I don't have -- (Laughter) You probably all have,\nand if you haven't, you need to. (Laughter) So I don't have a problem\nwith developers making money. There's enough precedent out there\nto show that a sustainable, community-friendly development\ncan still make a fortune. Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough\nand Amory Lovins -- both heroes of mine by the way --\nhave shown that you can actually do that. I do have a problem\nwith developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable\ncommunities for profit. That it continues is a shame upon us all, because we are all responsible\nfor the future that we create. But one of the things I do\nto remind myself of greater possibilities, is to learn from visionaries\nin other cities. This is my version of globalization. Let's take Bogota. Poor, Latino, surrounded by\nrunaway gun violence and drug trafficking; a reputation not unlike\nthat of the South Bronx. However, this city was blessed\nin the late 1990s with a highly-influential\nmayor named Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa. He looked at the demographics. Few Bogotanos own cars, yet a huge portion of the city's resources\nwas dedicated to serving them. If you're a mayor, you can\ndo something about that. His administration narrowed key municipal\nthoroughfares from five lanes to three, outlawed parking on those streets, expanded pedestrian walkways\nand bike lanes, created public plazas, created one of the most efficient\nbus mass-transit systems in the entire world. For his brilliant efforts,\nhe was nearly impeached. But as people began to see\nthat they were being put first on issues reflecting\ntheir day-to-day lives, incredible things happened. People stopped littering. Crime rates dropped, because the streets\nwere alive with people. His administration attacked several\ntypical urban problems at one time, and on a third-world budget, at that. We have no excuse\nin this country, I'm sorry. But the bottom line is:\ntheir people-first agenda was not meant to penalize\nthose who could actually afford cars, but rather, to provide opportunities\nfor all Bogotanos to participate in the city's resurgence. That development should not come at the expense of the majority\nof the population is still considered\na radical idea here in the U.S. But Bogota's example\nhas the power to change that. You, however, are blessed\nwith the gift of influence. That's why you're here and why you\nvalue the information we exchange. Use your influence in support of comprehensive,\nsustainable change everywhere. Don't just talk about it at TED. This is a nationwide policy agenda\nI'm trying to build, and as you all know,\npolitics are personal. Help me make green the new black. Help me make sustainability sexy. Make it a part of your dinner\nand cocktail conversations. Help me fight for environmental\nand economic justice. Support investments\nwith a triple-bottom-line return. Help me democratize sustainability\nby bringing everyone to the table, and insisting that comprehensive\nplanning can be addressed everywhere. Oh good, glad I have a little more time! Listen -- when I spoke to Mr. Gore\nthe other day after breakfast, I asked him how environmental justice\nactivists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy. His response was a grant program. I don't think he understood\nthat I wasn't asking for funding. I was making him an offer. (Applause) What troubled me was that this\ntop-down approach is still around. Now, don't get me wrong, we need money. (Laughter) But grassroots groups\nare needed at the table during the decision-making process. Of the 90 percent of the energy\nthat Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day, don't add wasting our energy, intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count. (Applause) I have come from so far\nto meet you like this. Please don't waste me. By working together, we can become one of those small,\nrapidly-growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually\ncan change the world. We might have come to this conference from very, very different\nstations in life, but believe me, we all share\none incredibly powerful thing. We have nothing to lose\nand everything to gain. Ciao, bellos! (Applause)",

        "transcript": "(Music: \"The Sound of Silence,\"\nSimon &amp; Garfunkel) Hello voice mail, my old friend. (Laughter) I've called for tech support again. I ignored my boss's warning. I called on a Monday morning. Now it's evening, and my dinner\nfirst grew cold, and then grew mold. I'm still on hold. I'm listening to the sounds of silence. I don't think you understand. I think your phone lines are unmanned. I punched every touch tone I was told, but I've still spent 18 hours on hold. It's not enough your software\ncrashed my Mac, and it constantly hangs and bombs -- it erased my ROMs! Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence. In my dreams I fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys. Say your motorcycle crashes. Blood comes gushing from your gashes. With your fading strength, you call 9-1-1\nand you pray for a trained MD. But you get me. (Laughter) And you listen to the sounds of silence. (Music) (Applause) Thank you. Good evening and welcome to: \"Spot the TED Presenter Who Used\nto Be a Broadway Accompanist.\" (Laughter) When I was offered the Times\ncolumn six years ago, the deal was like this: you'll be sent the coolest, hottest,\nslickest new gadgets. Every week, it'll arrive at your door. You get to try them out,\nplay with them, evaluate them until the novelty wears out,\nbefore you have to send them back, and you'll get paid for it. You can think about it, if you want. So, I've always been a technology nut,\nand I absolutely love it. The job, though, came with one\nsmall downside, and that is, they intended to publish my email address\nat the end of every column. And what I've noticed is -- first of all,\nyou get an incredible amount of email. If you ever are feeling lonely, get a New York Times column, because you will get hundreds\nand hundreds and hundreds of emails. And the email I'm getting a lot\ntoday is about frustration. People are feeling like things -- Ok, I just had an alarm\ncome up on my screen. Lucky you can't see it. People are feeling overwhelmed. They're feeling like\nit's too much technology, too fast. It may be good technology, but I feel like there's not enough\nof a support structure. There's not enough help. There's not enough thought\nput into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use. One time I wrote a column about my efforts\nto reach Dell Technical Support, and within 12 hours,\nthere were 700 messages from readers on the feedback boards\non the Times website, from users saying, \"\"Me too, and here's my tale of woe.\" I call it \"software rage.\" And man, let me tell you, whoever figures out how to make money\noff of this frustration will -- Oh, how did that\nget up there? Just kidding. (Laughter) Ok, so why is the problem accelerating? And part of the problem is, ironically, because the industry\nhas put so much thought into making things easier to use. I'll show you what I mean. This is what the computer\ninterface used to look like, DOS. Over the years, it's gotten easier to use. This is the original Mac operating system. Reagan was President.\nMadonna was still a brunette. And the entire operating system -- this is the good part -- the entire\noperating system fit in 211 k. You couldn't put\nthe Mac OS X logo in 211 k! (Laughter) So the irony is, that as these\nthings became easier to use, a less technical, broader audience\nwas coming into contact with this equipment for the first time. I once had the distinct privilege\nof sitting in on the Apple call center for a day. The guy had a duplicate headset\nfor me to listen to. And the calls that --\nyou know how they say, \"Your call may be recorded\nfor quality assurance?\" Uh-uh. Your call may be recorded so that they can collect\nthe funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD. (Laughter) Which they do. (Laughter) And I have a copy. (Laughter) It's in your gift bag. No, no. With your voices on it! So, some of the stories are just\nso classic, and yet so understandable. A woman called Apple to complain\nthat her mouse was squeaking. Making a squeaking noise. And the technician said, \"Well, ma'am, what do you mean\nyour mouse is squeaking?\" She says, \"All I can tell you\nis that it squeaks louder, the faster I move it across the screen.\" (Laughter) And the technician's like, \"Ma'am, you've got the mouse\nup against the screen?\" She goes, \"Well, the message said,\n'Click here to continue.'\" (Laughter) Well, if you like that one --\nhow much time have we got? Another one, a guy called --\nthis is absolutely true -- his computer had crashed,\nand he told the technician he couldn't restart it, no matter\nhow many times he typed \"11.\" And the technician said,\n\"What? Why are you typing 11?\" He said, \"The message says,\n'Error Type 11.'\" (Laughter) So, we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely\nat the feet of the users. But why is the technical overload crisis, the complexity crisis, accelerating now? In the hardware world, it's because\nwe the consumers want everything to be smaller,\nsmaller, smaller. So the gadgets are getting\ntinier and tinier, but our fingers are essentially\nstaying the same size. So it gets to be more and more\nof a challenge. Software is subject\nto another primal force: the mandate to release\nmore and more versions. When you buy a piece of software, it's not like buying a vase\nor a candy bar, where you own it. It's more like joining a club,\nwhere you pay dues every year, and every year, they say, \"We've added more features,\nand we'll sell it to you for $99.\" I know one guy who's spent $4,000\njust on Photoshop over the years. And software companies make\n35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades. I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox -- which is that if you improve\na piece of software enough times, you eventually ruin it. I mean, Microsoft Word was last\njust a word processor in, you know, the Eisenhower administration. (Laughter) But what's the alternative? Microsoft actually did this experiment. They said, \"Well, wait a minute. Everyone complains that\nwe're adding so many features. Let's create a word processor\nthat's just a word processor: Simple, pure; does not do web pages,\nis not a database.\" And it came out,\nand it was called Microsoft Write. And none of you are nodding\nin acknowledgment, because it died. It tanked. No one ever bought it. I call this the Sport Utility Principle. People like to surround themselves\nwith unnecessary power, right? They don't need the database\nand the website, but they're like, \"Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might,\nyou know, I might need that someday.\" So the problem is: as you add more\nfeatures, where are they going to go? Where are you going to stick them?\nYou only have so many design tools. You can do buttons, you can do\nsliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus. But if you're not careful\nabout how you choose, you wind up with this. (Laughter) This is an un-retouched --\nthis is not a joke -- un-retouched photo of Microsoft Word, the copy that you have,\nwith all the toolbars open. You've obviously never\nopened all the toolbars, but all you have to type in\nis this little, teeny window down here. (Laughter) And we've arrived at the age\nof interface matrices, where there are so many\nfeatures and options, you have to do two dimensions, you know: a vertical and a horizontal. You guys all complain about how Microsoft Word\nis always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically. The off switch is in there somewhere. I'm telling you -- it's there. Part of the art of designing\na simple, good interface, is knowing when to use\nwhich one of these features. So, here is the log-off\ndialogue box for Windows 2000. There are only four choices, so why are they in a pop-up menu? It's not like the rest of the screen\nis so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices. They could have put them all out in view. Here's Apple's take\non the exact same dialogue box. (Applause) Thank you -- yes, I designed\nthe dialogue box. No, no. Already, we can see\nthat Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent\napproach to software design. Microsoft's approach\nto simplicity tends to be: let's break it down;\nlet's just make it more steps. There are these \"wizards\" everywhere. And you know, there's a new version\nof Windows coming out this fall. If they continue at this pace,\nthere's absolutely no telling where they might wind up. [Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard] (Laughter) (Applause) \"Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard.\" Ok, I'll bite. Let's click \"Next\" to continue. (Laughter) (Applause) From the drop-down menu, choose\nthe first letter you want to type. Ok. (Laughter) So there is a limit\nthat we don't want to cross. So what is the answer? How do you pack in all these features\nin a simple, intelligent way? I believe in consistency, when possible, real-world equivalents, trash can folder, when possible,\nlabel things, mostly. But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules\nif they violate the biggest rule of all, which is intelligence. Now what do I mean by that? I'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something\nnot consistent, but it's better. If you are buying something on the web, you're supposed to put in your address, and you're supposed to choose\nwhat country you're from, ok? There are 200 countries in the world. We like to think of the Internet\nas a global village. I'm sorry; it's not one yet. It's mainly like, the United States,\nEurope, and Japan. So why is \"United States\" in the \"U\"s? (Laughter) You have to scroll, like,\nseven screensful to get to it. Now, it would be inconsistent\nto put \"United States\" first, but it would be intelligent. This one's been touched on before, but why in God's name do you\nshut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called \"Start?\" (Laughter) Here's another pet one of mine:\nyou have a printer. Most of the time, you want to print\none copy of your document, in page order, on that printer. So why in God's name do you see\nthis every time you print? It's like a 747 shuttle cockpit. (Laughter) And one of the buttons at the bottom,\nyou'll notice, is not \"Print.\" (Laughter) (Applause) Now, I'm not saying that Apple\nis the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity. Palm is also, especially in the old days,\nwonderful about this. I actually got to speak to Palm\nwhen they were flying high in the '90s, and after the talk,\nI met one of the employees. He says, \"Nice talk.\" And I said,\n\"Thank you. What do you do here?\" He said, \"I'm a tap counter.\"\nI'm like, \"You're a what?\" He goes, \"Well Jeff Hawkins,\nthe CEO, says, 'If any task on the Palm Pilot\ntakes more than three taps of the stylus, it's too long,\nand it has to be redesigned.' So I'm the tap counter.\" So, I'm going to show you an example of a company that does not\nhave a tap counter. (Laughter) This is Microsoft Word. Ok, when you want to create\na new blank document in Word -- it could happen. (Laughter) You go up to the \"File\" menu\nand you choose \"New.\" Now, what happens when you choose \"New?\" Do you get a new blank document? You do not. On the opposite side of the monitor,\na task bar appears, and somewhere in those links --\nby the way, not at the top -- somewhere in those links is a button\nthat makes you a new document. Ok, so that is a company\nnot counting taps. You know, I don't want to just stand\nhere and make fun of Microsoft ... Yes, I do. (Laughter) (Applause) The Bill Gates song! (Piano music) I've been a geek forever and I wrote the very first DOS. I put my software and IBM together; I got profit and they got the loss. (Laughter) I write the code\nthat makes the whole world run. I'm getting royalties from everyone. Sometimes it's garbage,\nbut the press is snowed. You buy the box; I'll sell the code. Every software company\nis doing Microsoft's R&amp;D. You can't keep a good idea\ndown these days. Even Windows is a hack. We're kind of based loosely on the Mac. So it's big, so it's slow.\nYou've got nowhere to go. I'm not doing this for praise. I write the code\nthat fits the world today. Big mediocrity in every way. We've entered planet domination mode. You'll have no choice; you'll buy my code. I am Bill Gates and I write the code. (Applause) But actually, I believe\nthere are really two Microsofts. There's the old one, responsible\nfor Windows and Office. They're dying to throw the whole thing\nout and start fresh, but they can't. They're locked in, because so many add-ons\nand other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis. But there's also a new Microsoft, that's really doing good,\nsimple interface designs. I liked the Media Center PC. I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch. The Wireless Watch\nflopped miserably in the market, but it wasn't because it wasn't\nsimply and beautifully designed. But let's put it this way: would you pay $10 a month to have a watch that has to be recharged\nevery night like your cell phone, and stops working\nwhen you leave your area code? (Laughter) So, the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch\nis only going to get worse. So is there any hope? The screens are getting smaller,\npeople are illuminating, putting manuals in the boxes, things are coming out at a faster pace. It's funny -- when Steve Jobs\ncame back to Apple in 1997, after 12 years away,\nit was the MacWorld Expo -- he came to the stage\nin that black turtleneck and jeans, and he sort of did this. The crowd went wild,\nbut I had just seen -- I'm like, where have I seen this before? I had just seen the movie \"Evita\" -- (Laughter) with Madonna, and I'm like, you know what? I've got to do one about Steve Jobs. (Music) It won't be easy.\nYou'll think I'm strange. (Laughter) When I try to explain why I'm back, after telling the press\nApple's future is black. You won't believe me. All that you see is a kid in his teens\nwho started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz. (Laughter) You try rhyming with garage! (Laughter) Don't cry for me, Cupertino. (Laughter) The truth is, I never left you. I know the ropes now,\nknow what the tricks are. I made a fortune over at Pixar. (Laughter) Don't cry for me, Cupertino. I've still got the drive and vision. I still wear sandals in any weather. It's just that these days, they're Gucci leather. (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. So Steve Jobs had always believed\nin simplicity and elegance and beauty. And the truth is, for years I was a little depressed, because Americans\nobviously did not value it, because the Mac had\nthree percent market share, Windows had 95 percent market share -- people did not think it was worth\nputting a price on it. So I was a little depressed. And then I heard Al Gore's talk, and I realized I didn't know\nthe meaning of depressed. (Laughter) But it turns out I was wrong, right? Because the iPod came out, and it violated every bit\nof common wisdom. Other products cost less;\nother products had more features, they had voice recorders\nand FM transmitters. The other products were backed\nby Microsoft, with an open standard, not Apple's propriety standard. But the iPod won --\nthis is the one they wanted. The lesson was: simplicity sells. And there are signs that the industry\nis getting the message. This is a little company that's done\nvery well with simplicity and elegance. The Sonos thing -- it's catching on. I've got just a couple examples. Physically, a really cool,\nelegant thinking coming along lately. When you have a digital camera, how do you get the pictures\nback to your computer? Well, you either haul around a USB cable, or you buy a card reader\nand haul that around. Either one, you're going to lose. What I do is, I take out the memory card, and I fold it in half,\nrevealing USB contacts. I just stick it in the computer,\noffload the pictures, put it right back in the camera. I never have to lose anything. Here's another example. Chris, you're the source of all power.\nWill you be my power plug? Chris Anderson: Oh yeah.\nDP: Hold that and don't let go. You might've seen this,\nthis is Apple's new laptop. This the power cord.\nIt hooks on like this. And I'm sure every one of you has done\nthis at some point in your lives, or one of your children. You walk along -- and I'm\nabout to pull this onto the floor. I don't care. It's a loaner. Here we go. Whoa! It's magnetic -- it doesn't pull\nthe laptop onto the floor. (Applause) In my very last example -- I do a lot of my work\nusing speech recognition software. And I'll just --\nyou have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous. Speech recognition\nsoftware is really great for doing emails very quickly; period. Like, I get hundreds of them\na day; period. And it's not just what I dictate\nthat it writes down; period. I also use this feature\ncalled voice macros; period. Correct \"dissuade.\" Not \"just.\" Ok, this is not an ideal situation, because it's getting the echo\nfrom the hall and stuff. The point is, I can respond to people\nvery quickly by saying a short word, and having it write out\na much longer thing. So if somebody\nsends me a fan letter, I'll say, \"Thanks for that.\" [Thank you so much\nfor taking the time to write ...] (Laughter) (Applause) And conversely, if somebody\nsends me hate mail -- which happens daily -- I say, \"Piss off.\" (Laughter) [I admire your frankness ...] (Laughter) (Applause) So that's my dirty little secret.\nDon't tell anyone. (Laughter) So the point is --\nthis is a really interesting story. This is version eight of this software, and do you know what they put\nin version eight? No new features. It's never\nhappened before in software! The company put no new features. They just said, \"We'll make\nthis software work right.\" Right? Because for years, people had bought\nthis software, tried it out -- 95 percent accuracy was all they got, which means one in 20 words is wrong -- and they'd put it in their drawer. And the company got sick of that, so they said, \"This version,\nwe're not going to do anything, but make sure it's darned accurate.\" And so that's what they did. This cult of doing things right\nis starting to spread. So, my final advice for those of you\nwho are consumers of this technology: remember, if it doesn't work,\nit's not necessarily you, ok? It could be the design\nof the thing you're using. Be aware in life\nof good design and bad design. And if you're among the people\nwho create this stuff: Easy is hard. Pre-sweat the details for your audience. Count the taps. Remember, the hard part\nis not deciding what features to add, it's deciding what to leave out. And best of all, your motivation is:\nsimplicity sells. CA: Bravo. DP: Thank you very much. CA: Hear, hear! (Applause)",

        "transcript": "Thank you so much, Chris. And it's truly a great honor\nto have the opportunity to come to this stage twice;\nI'm extremely grateful. I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you\nfor the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night. And I say that sincerely, partly because (Mock sob) I need that. (Laughter) Put yourselves in my position. (Laughter) I flew on Air Force Two for eight years. (Laughter) Now I have to take off my shoes\nor boots to get on an airplane! (Laughter) (Applause) I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what\nthat's been like for me. (Laughter) It's a true story --\nevery bit of this is true. Soon after Tipper and I left the --\n(Mock sob) White House -- (Laughter) we were driving from our home\nin Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville. Driving ourselves. (Laughter) I know it sounds like\na little thing to you, but -- (Laughter) I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. There was no motorcade back there. (Laughter) You've heard of phantom limb pain? (Laughter) This was a rented Ford Taurus. (Laughter) It was dinnertime, and we started looking for a place to eat. We were on I-40. We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee. We got off the exit,\nwe found a Shoney's restaurant. Low-cost family restaurant chain,\nfor those of you who don't know it. We went in and sat down at the booth,\nand the waitress came over, made a big commotion over Tipper. (Laughter) She took our order, and then went\nto the couple in the booth next to us, and she lowered her voice so much, I had to really strain to hear\nwhat she was saying. And she said \"Yes, that's former\nVice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper.\" And the man said, \"He's come down a long way, hasn't he?\" (Laughter) (Applause) There's been kind\nof a series of epiphanies. (Laughter) The very next day,\ncontinuing the totally true story, I got on a G-V to fly to Africa\nto make a speech in Nigeria, in the city of Lagos,\non the topic of energy. And I began the speech\nby telling them the story of what had just happened\nthe day before in Nashville. And I told it pretty much the same way\nI've just shared it with you: Tipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoney's, low-cost\nfamily restaurant chain, what the man said -- they laughed. I gave my speech, then went back\nout to the airport to fly back home. I fell asleep on the plane until, during the middle\nof the night, we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling. I woke up, they opened the door,\nI went out to get some fresh air, and I looked, and there was a man\nrunning across the runway. And he was waving a piece\nof paper, and he was yelling, \"Call Washington! Call Washington!\" And I thought to myself,\nin the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be\nwrong in Washington? Then I remembered\nit could be a bunch of things. (Laughter) But what it turned out to be, was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services\nin Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. It was printed in Monterey, I checked. (Laughter) And the story began, \"Former Vice President Al Gore\nannounced in Nigeria yesterday,\" quote: 'My wife Tipper and I have opened\na low-cost family restaurant'\" -- (Laughter) \"'named Shoney's, and we are running it ourselves.'\" (Laughter) Before I could get back to U.S. soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno\nhad already started in on -- one of them had me\nin a big white chef's hat, Tipper was saying,\n\"One more burger with fries!\" (Laughter) Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner\nand colleague Bill Clinton, saying, \"Congratulations\non the new restaurant, Al!\" (Laughter) We like to celebrate\neach other's successes in life. (Laughter) I was going to talk\nabout information ecology. But I was thinking that, since I plan to make a lifelong habit\nof coming back to TED, that maybe I could talk\nabout that another time. (Applause) Chris Anderson: It's a deal! (Applause) Al Gore: I want to focus\non what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on: What can you do about the climate crisis? I want to start with a couple of -- I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate\njust four or five. Now, the slide show. I update the slide show\nevery time I give it. I add new images, because I learn more about it\nevery time I give it. It's like beach-combing, you know? Every time the tide comes in and out,\nyou find some more shells. Just in the last two days, we got\nthe new temperature records in January. This is just for\nthe United States of America. Historical average\nfor Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees. Now, I know that you wanted some more\nbad news about the environment -- I'm kidding. But these are the recapitulation slides, and then I'm going to go into new\nmaterial about what you can do. But I wanted to elaborate\non a couple of these. First of all, this is where\nwe're projected to go with the U.S. contribution\nto global warming, under business as usual. Efficiency in end-use electricity\nand end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation --\nit's not a cost; it's a profit. The sign is wrong. It's not negative; it's positive. These are investments\nthat pay for themselves. But they are also very effective\nin deflecting our path. Cars and trucks -- I talked\nabout that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective. It's an easy, visible target of concern -- and it should be -- but there is more global warming pollution\nthat comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest\nstandards in the world. And so we should address that.\nBut it's part of the puzzle. Other transportation efficiency\nis as important as cars and trucks. Renewables at the current levels\nof technological efficiency can make this much difference. And with what Vinod, and John Doerr\nand others, many of you here -- there are a lot of people\ndirectly involved in this -- this wedge is going to grow\nmuch more rapidly than the current projection shows it. Carbon Capture and Sequestration --\nthat's what CCS stands for -- is likely to become the killer app\nthat will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels\nin a way that is safe. Not quite there yet. OK. Now, what can you do? Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures\nare also profitable. Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid. Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options\nthat are much better. It's important. Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect\non the global climate crisis. Consider this: Make a decision to live\na carbon-neutral life. Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way\nthat connects with the most people. It is easier than you think. It really is. A lot of us in here\nhave made that decision, and it is really pretty easy. It means reduce\nyour carbon dioxide emissions with the full range\nof choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not\ncompletely reduced. And what it means is elaborated\nat climatecrisis.net. There is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened -- with my active involvement -- the leading software writers in the world, on this arcane science\nof carbon calculation, to construct a consumer-friendly\ncarbon calculator. You can very precisely calculate\nwhat your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given\noptions to reduce. And by the time the movie\ncomes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click-through\npurchases of offsets. Next, consider making\nyour business carbon-neutral. Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions\ninto all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design\nand architecture community. Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this. Listen, if you have invested money\nwith managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don't ever again complain\nabout quarterly report CEO management. Over time, people do\nwhat you pay them to do. And if they judge how much\nthey're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested, based on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisions. A lot more to be said about that. Become a catalyst of change. Teach others, learn about it,\ntalk about it. The movie is a movie version\nof the slideshow I gave two nights ago,\nexcept it's a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May. Many of you here have the opportunity\nto ensure that a lot of people see it. Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well. And I am personally going to train people\nto give this slideshow -- re-purposed, with some\nof the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides,\nit's what they mean. And it's how they link together. And so I'm going to be conducting\na course this summer for a group of people that are\nnominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow\nfor all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge. Working with Larry Lessig, it will be,\nsomewhere in that process, posted with tools\nand limited-use copyrights, so that young people can remix it\nand do it in their own way. (Applause) Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay\narm's length from politics? It doesn't mean\nthat if you're a Republican, that I'm trying to convince you\nto be a Democrat. We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that\nin this group it really is. Become politically active. Make our democracy work the way\nit's supposed to work. Support the idea of capping\ncarbon dioxide emissions -- global warming pollution --\nand trading it. Here's why: as long as the United States\nis out of the world system, it's not a closed system. Once it becomes a closed system,\nwith U.S. participation, then everybody\nwho's on a board of directors -- how many people here\nserve on the board of directors of a corporation? Once it's a closed system, you will have legal liability\nif you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing\nand trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. The market will work\nto solve this problem -- if we can accomplish this. Help with the mass persuasion campaign\nthat will start this spring. We have to change the minds\nof the American people. Because presently, the politicians\ndo not have permission to do what needs to be done. And in our modern country, the role\nof logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power\nthe way it once did. It's now repetition of short, hot-button,\n30-second, 28-second television ads. We have to buy a lot of those ads. Let's re-brand global warming,\nas many of you have suggested. I like \"climate crisis\"\ninstead of \"climate collapse,\" but again, those of you\nwho are good at branding, I need your help on this. Somebody said the test\nwe're facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination\nof an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination. (Laughter) That's really true. I said the other night,\nand I'll repeat now: this is not a political issue. Again, the Republicans here --\nthis shouldn't be partisan. You have more influence\nthan some of us who are Democrats do. This is an opportunity. Not just this, but connected\nto the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them. We are one. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. (Applause)",

        "transcript": "About 10 years ago, I took on the task\nto teach global development to Swedish undergraduate students. That was after having spent\nabout 20 years, together with African institutions, studying hunger in Africa. So I was sort of expected\nto know a little about the world. And I started, in our medical university,\nKarolinska Institute, an undergraduate course\ncalled Global Health. But when you get that opportunity,\nyou get a little nervous. I thought, these students coming to us\nactually have the highest grade you can get in the Swedish college system, so I thought, maybe they know everything\nI'm going to teach them about. So I did a pretest when they came. And one of the questions\nfrom which I learned a lot was this one: \"Which country has the highest\nchild mortality of these five pairs?\" And I put them together\nso that in each pair of countries, one has twice the child\nmortality of the other. And this means that\nit's much bigger, the difference, than the uncertainty of the data. I won't put you at a test here,\nbut it's Turkey, which is highest there, Poland,\nRussia, Pakistan and South Africa. And these were the results\nof the Swedish students. I did it so I got the confidence interval,\nwhich is pretty narrow. And I got happy, of course -- a 1.8\nright answer out of five possible. That means there was a place\nfor a professor of international health and for my course. (Laughter) But one late night,\nwhen I was compiling the report, I really realized my discovery. I have shown that Swedish top students\nknow, statistically, significantly less about the world\nthan the chimpanzees. (Laughter) Because the chimpanzee\nwould score half right if I gave them two bananas\nwith Sri Lanka and Turkey. They would be right half of the cases.\nBut the students are not there. The problem for me was not ignorance;\nit was preconceived ideas. I did also an unethical study of the professors\nof the Karolinska Institute, which hands out\nthe Nobel Prize in Medicine, and they are on par\nwith the chimpanzee there. (Laughter) This is where I realized that\nthere was really a need to communicate, because the data\nof what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware. So we did this software,\nwhich displays it like this. Every bubble here is a country. This country over here is China. This is India. The size of the bubble is the population, and on this axis here,\nI put fertility rate. Because my students, what they said when they looked upon the world,\nand I asked them, \"What do you really\nthink about the world?\" Well, I first discovered\nthat the textbook was Tintin, mainly. (Laughter) And they said, \"The world\nis still 'we' and 'them.' And 'we' is the Western world\nand 'them' is the Third World.\" \"And what do you mean\nwith 'Western world?'\" I said. \"Well, that's long life and small family. And 'Third World' is short life\nand large family.\" So this is what I could display here. I put fertility rate here -- number of children per woman:\none, two, three, four, up to about eight children per woman. We have very good data\nsince 1962, 1960, about, on the size of families in all countries. The error margin is narrow. Here, I put life expectancy at birth, from 30 years in some countries,\nup to about 70 years. And in 1962, there was really\na group of countries here that were industrialized countries, and they had small families\nand long lives. And these were the developing countries. They had large families\nand they had relatively short lives. Now, what has happened since 1962?\nWe want to see the change. Are the students right?\nIt's still two types of countries? Or have these developing countries\ngot smaller families and they live here? Or have they got longer lives\nand live up there? Let's see. We stopped the world then. This is all UN statistics\nthat have been available. Here we go. Can you see there? It's China there, moving against\nbetter health there, improving there. All the green Latin American countries\nare moving towards smaller families. Your yellow ones here\nare the Arabic countries, and they get longer life,\nbut not larger families. The Africans are the green here.\nThey still remain here. This is India; Indonesia\nis moving on pretty fast. In the '80s here, you have Bangladesh\nstill among the African countries. But now, Bangladesh -- it's a miracle\nthat happens in the '80s -- the imams start to promote\nfamily planning, and they move up into that corner. And in the '90s, we have\nthe terrible HIV epidemic that takes down the life expectancy\nof the African countries. And the rest of them all\nmove up into the corner, where we have long lives and small family, and we have a completely new world. (Applause) (Applause ends) Let me make a comparison directly between the United States\nof America and Vietnam. 1964: America had small families and long life; Vietnam had large families\nand short lives. And this is what happens. The data during the war indicate\nthat even with all the death, there was an improvement\nof life expectancy. By the end of the year,\nfamily planning started in Vietnam, and they went for smaller families. And the United States up there\nis getting longer life, keeping family size. And in the '80s now,\nthey give up Communist planning and they go for market economy, and it moves faster even than social life. And today, we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy\nand the same family size here in Vietnam, 2003, as in United States, 1974,\nby the end of the war. I think we all, if we don't\nlook at the data, we underestimate\nthe tremendous change in Asia, which was in social change\nbefore we saw the economic change. So let's move over to another way here in which we could display\nthe distribution in the world of income. This is the world distribution\nof income of people. One dollar, 10 dollars\nor 100 dollars per day. There's no gap between rich\nand poor any longer. This is a myth. There's a little hump here. But there are people all the way. And if we look where the income ends up, this is 100 percent\nof the world's annual income. And the richest 20 percent, they take out of that about 74 percent. And the poorest 20 percent,\nthey take about two percent. And this shows that the concept\nof developing countries is extremely doubtful. We think about aid, like these people here giving aid\nto these people here. But in the middle, we have\nmost of the world population, and they have now\n24 percent of the income. We heard it in other forms. And who are these? Where are the different countries? I can show you Africa. This is Africa. Ten percent of the world population, most in poverty. This is OECD -- the rich countries,\nthe country club of the UN. And they are over here on this side.\nQuite an overlap between Africa and OECD. And this is Latin America. It has everything on this earth,\nfrom the poorest to the richest in Latin America. And on top of that,\nwe can put East Europe, we can put East Asia,\nand we put South Asia. And what did it look like\nif we go back in time, to about 1970? Then, there was more of a hump. And most who lived\nin absolute poverty were Asians. The problem in the world\nwas the poverty in Asia. And if I now let the world move forward, you will see that\nwhile population increases, there are hundreds of millions\nin Asia getting out of poverty, and some others getting into poverty, and this is the pattern we have today. And the best projection\nfrom the World Bank is that this will happen, and we will not have a divided world. We'll have most people in the middle. Of course it's a logarithmic scale here, but our concept of economy\nis growth with percent. We look upon it as a possibility\nof percentile increase. If I change this and take GDP per capita\ninstead of family income, and I turn these individual data into regional data\nof gross domestic product, and I take the regions down here, the size of the bubble\nis still the population. And you have the OECD there,\nand you have sub-Saharan Africa there, and we take off the Arab states there, coming both from Africa and from Asia, and we put them separately, and we can expand this axis,\nand I can give it a new dimension here, by adding the social values\nthere, child survival. Now I have money on that axis, and I have the possibility\nof children to survive there. In some countries, 99.7% of children\nsurvive to five years of age; others, only 70. And here, it seems,\nthere is a gap between OECD, Latin America, East Europe, East Asia, Arab states, South Asia\nand sub-Saharan Africa. The linearity is very strong\nbetween child survival and money. But let me split sub-Saharan Africa. Health is there\nand better health is up there. I can go here, and I can split\nsub-Saharan Africa into its countries. And when it bursts, the size of each country bubble\nis the size of the population. Sierra Leone down there,\nMauritius is up there. Mauritius was the first country\nto get away with trade barriers, and they could sell their sugar,\nthey could sell their textiles, on equal terms as the people\nin Europe and North America. There's a huge difference [within] Africa. And Ghana is here in the middle. In Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid. Here in Uganda, development aid. Here, time to invest;\nthere, you can go for a holiday. There's tremendous variation\nwithin Africa, which we very often make\nthat it's equal everything. I can split South Asia here.\nIndia's the big bubble in the middle. But there's a huge difference\nbetween Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. I can split Arab states. How are they? Same climate, same culture,\nsame religion -- huge difference. Even between neighbors -- Yemen, civil war; United Arab Emirates, money,\nwhich was quite equally and well-used. Not as the myth is. And that includes all the children\nof the foreign workers who are in the country. Data is often better than you think.\nMany people say data is bad. There is an uncertainty margin,\nbut we can see the difference here: Cambodia, Singapore. The differences are much bigger\nthan the weakness of the data. East Europe: Soviet economy\nfor a long time, but they come out after 10 years\nvery, very differently. And there is Latin America. Today, we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country\nin Latin America. Chile will have a lower child mortality\nthan Cuba within some few years from now. Here, we have high-income\ncountries in the OECD. And we get the whole pattern\nhere of the world, which is more or less like this. And if we look at it, how the world looks, in 1960, it starts to move. This is Mao Zedong.\nHe brought health to China. And then he died. And then Deng Xiaoping came\nand brought money to China, and brought them\ninto the mainstream again. And we have seen how countries\nmove in different directions like this, so it's sort of difficult to get\nan example country which shows the pattern of the world. But I would like to bring you back\nto about here, at 1960. I would like to compare\nSouth Korea, which is this one, with Brazil, which is this one. The label went away for me here. And I would like to compare\nUganda, which is there. I can run it forward, like this. And you can see how South Korea is making\na very, very fast advancement, whereas Brazil is much slower. And if we move back again, here,\nand we put trails on them, like this, you can see again that the speed of development\nis very, very different, and the countries are moving\nmore or less at the same rate as money and health, but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first\nthan if you are wealthy first. And to show that, you can put\non the way of United Arab Emirates. They came from here, a mineral country. They cached all the oil;\nthey got all the money; but health cannot be bought\nat the supermarket. You have to invest in health.\nYou have to get kids into schooling. You have to train health staff.\nYou have to educate the population. And Sheikh Zayed did that\nin a fairly good way. In spite of falling oil prices,\nhe brought this country up here. So we've got a much more mainstream\nappearance of the world, where all countries tend\nto use their money better than they used it in the past. Now, this is, more or less, if you look\nat the average data of the countries -- they are like this. That's dangerous, to use average data, because there is such\na lot of difference within countries. So if I go and look here, we can see that Uganda today\nis where South Korea was in 1960. If I split Uganda, there's quite\na difference within Uganda. These are the quintiles of Uganda. The richest 20 percent\nof Ugandans are there. The poorest are down there. If I split South Africa, it's like this. And if I go down and look at Niger, where there was such\na terrible famine [recently], it's like this. The 20 percent poorest\nof Niger is out here, and the 20 percent richest\nof South Africa is there, and yet we tend to discuss\nwhat solutions there should be in Africa. Everything in this world exists in Africa. And you can't discuss\nuniversal access to HIV [treatment] for that quintile up here with the same strategy as down here. The improvement of the world\nmust be highly contextualized, and it's not relevant to have it\non a regional level. We must be much more detailed. We find that students get very excited\nwhen they can use this. And even more, policy makers\nand the corporate sectors would like to see\nhow the world is changing. Now, why doesn't this take place? Why are we not using the data we have? We have data in the United Nations,\nin the national statistical agencies and in universities and other\nnongovernmental organizations. Because the data is hidden\ndown in the databases. And the public is there,\nand the internet is there, but we have still not used it effectively. All that information\nwe saw changing in the world does not include\npublicly funded statistics. There are some web pages\nlike this, you know, but they take some nourishment\ndown from the databases, but people put prices on them,\nstupid passwords and boring statistics. (Laughter) And this won't work. (Applause) So what is needed? We have the databases. It's not a new database that you need. We have wonderful design tools\nand more and more are added up here. So we started a nonprofit venture\nlinking data to design, we called \"Gapminder,\" from the London Underground,\nwhere they warn you, \"Mind the gap.\" So we thought Gapminder was appropriate. And we started to write software\nwhich could link the data like this. And it wasn't that difficult. It took some person years,\nand we have produced animations. You can take a data set and put it there. We are liberating UN data,\nsome few UN organization. Some countries accept that\ntheir databases can go out on the world. But what we really need is,\nof course, a search function, a search function where we can copy\nthe data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world. And what do we hear when we go around? I've done anthropology\non the main statistical units. Everyone says, \"It's impossible.\nThis can't be done. Our information is so peculiar in detail, so that cannot be searched\nas others can be searched. We cannot give the data\nfree to the students, free to the entrepreneurs of the world.\" But this is what we would\nlike to see, isn't it? The publicly funded data is down here. And we would like flowers\nto grow out on the net. One of the crucial points\nis to make them searchable, and then people can use the different\ndesign tools to animate it there. And I have pretty good news for you. I have good news that the [current], new head of UN statistics\ndoesn't say it's impossible. He only says, \"We can't do it.\" (Laughter) And that's a quite clever guy, huh? (Laughter) So we can see a lot happening\nin data in the coming years. We will be able to look at income\ndistributions in completely new ways. This is the income distribution\nof China, 1970. This is the income distribution\nof the United States, 1970. Almost no overlap. Almost no overlap. And what has happened? What has happened is this: that China is growing,\nit's not so equal any longer, and it's appearing here,\noverlooking the United States, almost like a ghost, isn't it? (Laughter) It's pretty scary. (Laughter) But I think it's very important\nto have all this information. We need really to see it. And instead of looking at this, I would like to end up by showing\nthe internet users per 1,000. In this software, we access\nabout 500 variables from all the countries quite easily. It takes some time to change for this, but on the axes, you can quite easily\nget any variable you would like to have. And the thing would be\nto get up the databases free, to get them searchable,\nand with a second click, to get them into the graphic formats,\nwhere you can instantly understand them. Now, statisticians don't like it,\nbecause they say that this will not show the reality; we have to have statistical,\nanalytical methods. But this is hypothesis-generating. I end now with the world. There, the internet is coming. The number of internet users\nare going up like this. This is the GDP per capita. And it's a new technology coming in,\nbut then amazingly, how well it fits to the economy\nof the countries. That's why the $100 computer\nwill be so important. But it's a nice tendency. It's as if the world\nis flattening off, isn't it? These countries are lifting more\nthan the economy, and it will be very interesting\nto follow this over the year, as I would like you to be able to do\nwith all the publicly funded data. Thank you very much. (Applause)",

This results in lots of money & effort being misdirected in attempts to make things better. This is very poor use of public funds. I find this rather frustrating. \nMost everyone wants to make the world a better place & that's a great thing but when the population doesn't  understand the problems properly, efforts to improve things get misdirected. \nThis is true for any field. We have to understand the problems properly before we can solve those problems efficiently but we seldom do that. Some problem or issue gets attention on the news & we end up getting bombarded with it. Then the population overall gets a skewed perception of the issues & we end up pouring money & effort into something that really is minor while we ignore serious issues because we aren't aware of them. \nI love what Hans Rosling does. He educates people & paints an accurate picture of the issues & that really is, or should be, the first step.

        "transcript": "Thank you. I have to tell you\nI'm both challenged and excited. My excitement is: I get a chance\nto give something back. My challenge is: the shortest seminar\nI usually do is 50 hours. (Laughter) I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends -- I do more, obviously,\nI also coach people -- but I'm into immersion,\nbecause how did you learn language? Not just by learning principles, you got in it and you did it\nso often that it became real. The bottom line of why I'm here,\nbesides being a crazy mofo, is that -- I'm not here to motivate you,\nyou don't need that, obviously. Often that's what people think I do, and it's the furthest thing from it. What happens, though, is people say to me, \"I don't need any motivation.\" But that's not what I do. I'm the \"why\" guy. I want to know why you do what you do. What is your motive for action? What is it that drives you\nin your life today? Not 10 years ago. Are you running the same pattern? Because I believe that the invisible force\nof internal drive, activated, is the most important thing. I'm here because I believe\nemotion is the force of life. All of us here have great minds. Most of us here have great minds, right? We all know how to think. With our minds we can\nrationalize anything. We can make anything happen. I agree with what was described\na few days ago, that people work in their self-interest. But we know that that's bullshit at times. You don't work in your\nself-interest all the time, because when emotion comes into it, the wiring changes\nin the way it functions. So it's wonderful to think intellectually\nabout how the life of the world is, especially those who are very smart\ncan play this game in our head. But I really want to know\nwhat's driving you. What I would like to invite you to do by the end of this talk is explore\nwhere you are today, for two reasons. One: so that you can contribute more. And two: that hopefully we can not just\nunderstand other people more, but appreciate them more,\nand create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challenges\nthat we face today. They're only going to get magnified\nby the very technology that connects us, because it's making us intersect. That intersection\ndoesn't always create a view of \"everybody now understands everybody, and everybody appreciates everybody.\" I've had an obsession\nbasically for 30 years, \"What makes the difference\nin the quality of people's lives? What in their performance?\" I got hired to produce the result now. I've done it for 30 years. I get the phone call when the athlete is burning down\non national television, and they were ahead by five strokes and now they can't get back on the course. I've got to do something right now\nor nothing matters. I get the phone call when the child\nis going to commit suicide, I've got to do something. In 29 years, I'm very grateful\nto tell you I've never lost one. It doesn't mean I won't some day,\nbut I haven't yet. The reason is an understanding\nof these human needs. When I get those calls\nabout performance, that's one thing. How do you make a change? I'm also looking to see what is shaping\nthe person's ability to contribute, to do something beyond themselves. Maybe the real question is, I look at life and say\nthere's two master lessons. One is: there's the science\nof achievement, which almost everyone here\nhas mastered amazingly. \"How do you take the invisible\nand make it visible,\" How do you make your dreams happen? Your business, your contribution\nto society, money -- whatever, your body, your family. The other lesson that is rarely\nmastered is the art of fulfillment. Because science is easy, right? We know the rules, you write the code\nand you get the results. Once you know the game,\nyou just up the ante, don't you? But when it comes\nto fulfillment -- that's an art. The reason is, it's about\nappreciation and contribution. You can only feel so much by yourself. I've had an interesting laboratory\nto try to answer the real question how somebody's life changes if you look at them like those people\nthat you've given everything to? Like all the resources they say they need. You gave not a 100-dollar computer,\nbut the best computer. You gave them love, joy,\nwere there to comfort them. Those people very often --\nyou know some of them -- end up the rest of their life with all this love, education,\nmoney and background going in and out of rehab. Some people have been\nthrough ultimate pain, psychologically, sexually,\nspiritually, emotionally abused -- and not always, but often, they become some of the people\nthat contribute the most to society. The question we've got to ask\nourselves really is, what is it? What is it that shapes us? We live in a therapy culture. Most of us don't do that,\nbut the culture's a therapy culture, the mindset that we are our past. And you wouldn't be in this room\nif you bought that, but most of society\nthinks biography is destiny. The past equals the future. Of course it does if you live there. But what we know and what\nwe have to remind ourselves -- because you can know\nsomething intellectually and then not use it, not apply it. We've got to remind ourselves\nthat decision is the ultimate power. When you ask people, have you failed to achieve\nsomething significant in your life? Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye. TR: Thanks for the interaction\non a high level there. But if you ask people,\nwhy didn't you achieve something? Somebody who's working for you,\nor a partner, or even yourself. When you fail to achieve,\nwhat's the reason people say? What do they tell you? Didn't have the knowledge,\ndidn't have the money, didn't have the time,\ndidn't have the technology. I didn't have the right manager. Al Gore: Supreme Court.\nTR: The Supreme Court. (Laughter) (Applause) (Cheering) (Applause continues) TR: And -- (Applause) What do all those, including\nthe Supreme Court, have in common? (Laughter) They are a claim to you missing\nresources, and they may be accurate. You may not have the money,\nor the Supreme Court, but that is not the defining factor. (Applause) (Laughter) And you correct me if I'm wrong. The defining factor is never resources;\nit's resourcefulness. And what I mean specifically,\nrather than just some phrase, is if you have emotion, human emotion, something that I experienced from you\nthe day before yesterday at a level that is as profound\nas I've ever experienced and I believe with that emotion\nyou would have beat his ass and won. Audience: Yeah! (Applause) (Cheering) How easy for me to tell him\nwhat he should do. (Laughter) Idiot, Robbins. But I know when we watched\nthe debate at that time, there were emotions\nthat blocked people's ability to get this man's intellect and capacity. And the way that it came across\nto some people on that day -- because I know people that wanted\nto vote in your direction and didn't, and I was upset. But there was emotion there. Do you know what I'm talking about? Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye. TR: So, emotion is it. And if we get the right emotion,\nwe can get ourselves to do anything. If you're creative, playful, fun enough, can you get through to anybody, yes or no? If you don't have the money, but you're creative and determined,\nyou find the way. This is the ultimate resource. But this is not the story\nthat people tell us. They tell us a bunch of different stories. They tell us we don't have\nthe resources, but ultimately, if you take a look here, they say, what are all the reasons\nthey haven't accomplished that? He's broken my pattern,\nthat son-of-a-bitch. (Laughter) But I appreciated the energy,\nI'll tell you that. (Laughter) What determines your resources? We've said decisions shape destiny,\nwhich is my focus here. If decisions shape destiny,\nwhat determines it is three decisions. What will you focus on? You have to decide\nwhat you're going to focus on. Consciously or unconsciously. the minute you decide to focus,\nyou must give it a meaning, and that meaning produces emotion. Is this the end or the beginning? Is God punishing me or rewarding me,\nor is this the roll of the dice? An emotion creates\nwhat we're going to do, or the action. So, think about your own life, the decisions that\nhave shaped your destiny. And that sounds really heavy,\nbut in the last five or 10 years, have there been some decisions that if you'd made a different decision,\nyour life would be completely different? How many can think about it?\nBetter or worse. Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye. So the bottom line is,\nmaybe it was where to go to work, and you met the love of your life there,\na career decision. I know the Google geniuses I saw here -- I mean, I understand that their decision\nwas to sell their technology. What if they made that decision\nversus to build their own culture? How would the world or their lives\nbe different, their impact? The history of our world\nis these decisions. When a woman stands up and says,\n\"No, I won't go to the back of the bus.\" She didn't just affect her life.\nThat decision shaped our culture. Or someone standing in front of a tank. Or being in a position\nlike Lance Armstrong, \"You've got testicular cancer.\" That's pretty tough for any male,\nespecially if you ride a bike. (Laughter) You've got it in your brain;\nyou've got it in your lungs. But what was his decision\nof what to focus on? Different than most people.\nWhat did it mean? It wasn't the end; it was the beginning. He goes off and wins\nseven championships he never once won before the cancer, because he got\nemotional fitness, psychological strength. That's the difference\nin human beings that I've seen of the three million I've been around. In my lab, I've had three million people\nfrom 80 countries over the last 29 years. And after a while,\npatterns become obvious. You see that South America and Africa\nmay be connected in a certain way, right? Others say, \"Oh, that sounds\nridiculous.\" It's simple. So, what shaped Lance? What shapes you? Two invisible forces.\nVery quickly. One: state. We all have had times, you did something, and after,\nyou thought to yourself, \"I can't believe I said or did that,\nthat was so stupid.\" Who's been there? Say, \"Aye.\"\nAudience: Aye. Or after you did something,\nyou go, \"That was me!\" (Laughter) It wasn't your ability; it was your state. Your model of the world\nis what shapes you long term. Your model of the world is the filter.\nThat's what's shaping us. It makes people make decisions. To influence somebody, we need to know\nwhat already influences them. It's made up of three parts. First, what's your target?\nWhat are you after? It's not your desires. You can get your desires or goals. Who has ever got a goal or desire\nand thought, is this all there is? Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye. It's needs we have. I believe\nthere are six human needs. Second, once you know what the target\nthat's driving you is and you uncover it for the truth --\nyou don't form it -- then you find out what's your map, what's the belief systems\nthat tell you how to get those needs. Some people think the way\nto get them is to destroy the world, some people, to build,\ncreate something, love someone. There's the fuel you pick.\nSo very quickly, six needs. Let me tell you what they are.\nFirst one: certainty. These are not goals or desires,\nthese are universal. Everyone needs certainty\nthey can avoid pain and at least be comfortable. Now, how do you get it? Control everybody? Develop a skill?\nGive up? Smoke a cigarette? And if you got totally\ncertain, ironically, even though we need that -- you're not certain about your health,\nor your children, or money. If you're not sure\nthe ceiling will hold up, you won't listen to any speaker. While we go for certainty differently,\nif we get total certainty, we get what? What do you feel if you're certain? You know what will happen,\nwhen and how it will happen, what would you feel? Bored out of your minds.\nSo, God, in Her infinite wisdom, gave us a second human need,\nwhich is uncertainty. We need variety. We need surprise. How many of you here\nlove surprises? Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye. TR: Bullshit. You like\nthe surprises you want. The ones you don't want,\nyou call problems, but you need them. So, variety is important. Have you ever rented a video\nor a film that you've already seen? Who's done this? Get a fucking life. (Laughter) Why are you doing it? You're certain it's good\nbecause you read or saw it before, but you're hoping it's been\nlong enough you've forgotten, and there's variety. Third human need, critical: significance. We all need to feel important,\nspecial, unique. You can get it by making more money\nor being more spiritual. You can do it by getting yourself\nin a situation where you put more tattoos and earrings in places\nhumans don't want to know. Whatever it takes. The fastest way to do this, if you have no background,\nno culture, no belief and resources or resourcefulness, is violence. If I put a gun to your head and I live\nin the 'hood, instantly I'm significant. Zero to 10. How high? 10. How certain am I that\nyou're going to respond to me? 10. How much uncertainty? Who knows what's going to happen next?\nKind of exciting. Like climbing up into a cave\nand doing that stuff all the way down there. Total variety and uncertainty. And it's significant, isn't it?\nSo you want to risk your life for it. So that's why violence has always\nbeen around and will be around unless we have a consciousness\nchange as a species. You can get significance a million ways, but to be significant, you've got\nto be unique and different. Here's what we really need:\nconnection and love, fourth need. We all want it; most settle for connection,\nlove's too scary. Who here has been hurt\nin an intimate relationship? If you don't raise your hand,\nyou've had other shit, too. And you're going to get hurt again. Aren't you glad you came\nto this positive visit? Here's what's true: we need it. We can do it through\nintimacy, friendship, prayer, through walking in nature. If nothing else works for you,\ndon't get a cat, get a dog, because if you leave for two minutes,\nit's like you've been gone six months, when you come back 5 minutes later. These first four needs,\nevery human finds a way to meet. Even if you lie to yourself,\nyou need to have split personalities. I call the first four needs\nthe needs of the personality. The last two are the needs of the spirit. And this is where fulfillment comes. You won't get it from the first four. You'll figure a way, smoke, drink,\ndo whatever, meet the first four. But number five, you must grow. We all know the answer. If you don't grow, you're what? If a relationship or business\nis not growing, if you're not growing, doesn't matter how much\nmoney or friends you have, how many love you, you feel like hell. And I believe the reason we grow is so we have something to give of value. Because the sixth need\nis to contribute beyond ourselves. Because we all know, corny as that sounds, the secret to living is giving. We all know life is not about me,\nit's about we. This culture knows that,\nthis room knows that. It's exciting. When you see Nicholas\ntalking about his $100 computer, the most exciting thing is: here's a genius,\nbut he's got a calling now. You can feel the difference in him,\nand it's beautiful. And that calling can touch other people. My life was touched\nbecause when I was 11 years old, Thanksgiving, no money, no food, we were not going to starve, but my father was totally messed up, my mom was letting him know\nhow bad he messed up, and somebody came to the door\nand delivered food. My father made three decisions,\nI know what they were, briefly. His focus was \"This is charity. What does it mean? I'm worthless. What do I have to do?\nLeave my family,\" which he did. It was one of the most painful\nexperiences of life. My three decisions\ngave me a different path. I set focus on \"There's food.\"\nWhat a concept! (Laughter) But this is what changed my life,\nshaped me as a human being. Somebody's gift,\nI don't even know who it is. My father always said,\n\"No one gives a shit.\" And now somebody I don't know, they're not asking for anything,\njust giving us food, looking out for us. It made me believe this:\nthat strangers care. And that made me decide, if strangers care about me and my family,\nI care about them. I'm going to do something\nto make a difference. So when I was 17,\nI went out on Thanksgiving, it was my target for years to have\nenough money to feed two families. The most fun and moving thing\nI ever did in my life. Next year, I did four, then eight. I didn't tell anybody what I was doing,\nI wasn't doing it for brownie points. But after eight,\nI thought I could use some help. So I went out, got my friends involved, then I grew companies, got 11,\nand I built the foundation. 18 years later, I'm proud to tell you last year we fed\n2 million people in 35 countries through our foundation. All during the holidays,\nThanksgiving, Christmas, in different countries around the world. (Applause) Thank you. I don't tell you that to brag,\nbut because I'm proud of human beings because they get excited to contribute once they've had the chance\nto experience it, not talk about it. So, finally -- I'm about out of time. The target that shapes you -- Here's what's different about people. We have the same needs. But are you a certainty freak,\nis that what you value most, or uncertainty? This man couldn't be a certainty freak\nif he climbed through those caves. Are you driven by significance or love? We all need all six, but what your lead system is\ntilts you in a different direction. And as you move in a direction,\nyou have a destination or destiny. The second piece is the map. The operating system\ntells you how to get there, and some people's map is, \"I'm going to save lives\neven if I die for other people,\" and they're a fireman, and somebody else says,\n\"I'm going to kill people to do it.\" They're trying to meet\nthe same needs of significance. They want to honor God\nor honor their family. But they have a different map. And there are seven different beliefs;\nI can't go through them, because I'm done. The last piece is emotion. One of the parts of the map is like time. Some people's idea\nof a long time is 100 years. Somebody else's is three seconds,\nwhich is what I have. And the last one I've already mentioned\nthat fell to you. If you've got a target and a map -- I can't use Google because I love Macs, and they haven't made it\ngood for Macs yet. So if you use MapQuest -- how many have made\nthis fatal mistake of using it? You use this thing\nand you don't get there. Imagine if your beliefs guarantee\nyou can never get to where you want to go. (Laughter) The last thing is emotion. Here's what I'll tell you about emotion. There are 6,000 emotions that we have words for\nin the English language, which is just a linguistic representation\nthat changes by language. But if your dominant emotions -- If I have 20,000 people or 1,000 and I have them write down\nall the emotions that they experience in an average week, and I give them as long as they need, and on one side\nthey write empowering emotions, the other's disempowering, guess how many emotions\nthey experience? Less than 12. And half of those\nmake them feel like shit. They have six good feelings. Happy, happy, excited, oh shit, frustrated, frustrated,\noverwhelmed, depressed. How many of you know somebody who, no matter what happens,\nfinds a way to get pissed off? (Laughter) Or no matter what happens,\nthey find a way to be happy or excited. How many of you know somebody like this? When 9/11 happened, I'll finish\nwith this, I was in Hawaii. I was with 2,000 people from 45 countries, we were translating\nfour languages simultaneously for a program I was conducting,\nfor a week. The night before was called\nEmotional Mastery. I got up, had no plan\nfor this, and I said -- we had fireworks,\nI do crazy shit, fun stuff, and at the end, I stopped. I had this plan, but I never know\nwhat I'm going to say. And all of a sudden, I said, \"When do people really start to live?\nWhen they face death.\" And I went through this whole thing about, if you weren't going\nto get off this island, if nine days from now,\nyou were going to die, who would you call,\nwhat would you say, what would you do? That night is when 9/11 happened. One woman had come to the seminar,\nand when she came there, her previous boyfriend had been\nkidnapped and murdered. Her new boyfriend wanted to marry her,\nand she said no. He said, \"If you go to that Hawaii thing,\nit's over with us.\" She said, \"It's over.\" When I finished that night,\nshe called him and left a message at the top of the World Trade Center\nwhere he worked, saying, \"I love you, I want you to know\nI want to marry you. It was stupid of me.\" She was asleep, because it was 3 a.m.\nfor us, when he called her back, and said, \"Honey, I can't tell you\nwhat this means. I don't know how to tell you this,\nbut you gave me the greatest gift, because I'm going to die.\" And she played the recording\nfor us in the room. She was on Larry King later. And he said, \"You're probably wondering how on Earth this could\nhappen to you twice. All I can say is this must be\nGod's message to you. From now on, every day,\ngive your all, love your all. Don't let anything ever stop you.\" She finishes, and a man\nstands up, and he says, \"I'm from Pakistan, I'm a Muslim. I'd love to hold your hand\nand say I'm sorry, but frankly, this is retribution.\" I can't tell you the rest,\nbecause I'm out of time. (Laughter) Are you sure? (Laughter) 10 seconds! (Laughter and applause) 10 seconds, I want to be respectful. All I can tell you is, I brought this man on stage with a man from New York who worked\nin the World Trade Center, because I had about 200 New Yorkers there. More than 50 lost\ntheir entire companies, friends, marking off their Palm Pilots. One financial trader,\nwoman made of steel, bawling -- 30 friends crossing off that all died. And I said, \"What are we\ngoing to focus on? What does this mean\nand what are we going to do?\" And I got the group to focus on: if you didn't lose somebody today, your focus is going to be\nhow to serve somebody else. Then one woman stood up\nand was so angry, screaming and yelling. I found out she wasn't from New York,\nshe's not an American, doesn't know anybody here. I asked, \"Do you always get angry?\" She said, \"Yes.\" Guilty people got guilty,\nsad people got sad. I took these two men\nand I did an indirect negotiation. Jewish man with family\nin the occupied territory, someone in New York who would have died\nif he was at work that day, and this man who wanted to be a terrorist, and I made it very clear. This integration is on a film,\nwhich I'd be happy to send you, instead of my verbalization, but the two of them not only came together and changed their beliefs\nand models of the world, but worked together to bring,\nfor almost four years now, through various mosques and synagogues, the idea of how to create peace. And he wrote a book, called\n\"My Jihad, My Way of Peace.\" So, transformation can happen. My invitation to you is: explore your web, the web in here -- the needs, the beliefs, the emotions\nthat are controlling you, for two reasons: so there's more of you to give,\nand achieve, too, but I mean give, because that's what's\ngoing to fill you up. And secondly, so you can appreciate -- not just understand,\nthat's intellectual, that's the mind, but appreciate\nwhat's driving other people. It's the only way\nour world's going to change. God bless you, thank you.\nI hope this was of service. (Applause)",

        "transcript": "On September 10, the morning\nof my seventh birthday, I came downstairs to the kitchen,\nwhere my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading\nthe paper or something, and I sort of presented myself to them\nin the doorway, and they said, \"Hey, happy birthday!\"\nAnd I said, \"I'm seven.\" And my father smiled and said, \"Well, you know\nwhat that means, don't you?\" And I said, \"Yeah,\nthat I'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents?\" And my dad said, \"Well, yes. But more importantly, being seven means that\nyou've reached the age of reason, and you're now capable of committing\nany and all sins against God and man.\" (Laughter) Now, I had heard this phrase,\n\"age of reason,\" before. Sister Mary Kevin\nhad been bandying it about my second-grade class at school. But when she said it, the phrase seemed all caught up\nin the excitement of preparations for our first communion\nand our first confession, and everybody knew that was really\nall about the white dress and the white veil. And anyway, I hadn't really paid\nall that much attention to that phrase, \"age of reason.\" So, I said, \"Yeah, yeah, age of reason.\nWhat does that mean again?\" And my dad said, \"Well, we believe,\nin the Catholic Church, that God knows that little kids don't know\nthe difference between right and wrong, but when you're seven,\nyou're old enough to know better. So, you've grown up\nand reached the age of reason, and now God will start\nkeeping notes on you, and begin your permanent record.\" (Laughter) And I said, \"Oh ... Wait a minute. You mean all that time, up till today, all that time I was so good,\nGod didn't notice it?\" And my mom said, \"Well, I noticed it.\" (Laughter) And I thought, \"How could\nI not have known this before? How could it not have sunk in\nwhen they'd been telling me? All that being good\nand no real credit for it. And worst of all,\nhow could I not have realized this very important information until the very day\nthat it was basically useless to me?\" So I said, \"Well, Mom and Dad,\nwhat about Santa Claus? I mean, Santa Claus knows\nif you're naughty or nice, right?\" And my dad said, \"Yeah, but, honey, I think that's technically just\nbetween Thanksgiving and Christmas.\" And my mother said, \"Oh, Bob, stop it.\nLet's just tell her. I mean, she's seven. Julie, there is no Santa Claus.\" (Laughter) Now, this was actually\nnot that upsetting to me. My parents had this whole\nelaborate story about Santa Claus: how they had talked to Santa Claus\nhimself and agreed that instead of Santa\ndelivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve, like he did for every other family\nwho got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning, our family would give Santa more time. Santa would come to our house\nwhile we were at nine o'clock high mass on Christmas morning, but only\nif all of us kids did not make a fuss. Which made me very suspicious. It was pretty obvious that it was really\nour parents giving us the presents. I mean, my dad had a very\ndistinctive wrapping style, and my mother's handwriting\nwas so close to Santa's. (Laughter) Plus, why would Santa save time\nby having to loop back to our house after he'd gone\nto everybody else's? There was only one obvious conclusion\nto reach from this mountain of evidence: our family was too strange and weird\nfor even Santa Claus to come visit, and my poor parents were trying\nto protect us from the embarrassment, this humiliation of rejection\nby Santa, who was jolly -- but let's face it,\nhe was also very judgmental. So to find out that there was\nno Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief. I left the kitchen not really\nin shock about Santa, but rather, I was just dumbfounded about how I could have missed\nthis whole age of reason thing. It was too late for me,\nbut maybe I could help someone else, someone who could use the information. They had to fit two criteria: they had to be old enough\nto be able to understand the whole concept of the age\nof reason, and not yet seven. The answer was clear:\nmy brother Bill. He was six. Well, I finally found Bill about a block away from our house\nat this public school playground. It was a Saturday,\nand he was all by himself, just kicking a ball\nagainst the side of a wall. I ran up to him and said, \"Bill! I just realized that the age of reason\nstarts when you turn seven, and then you're capable\nof committing any and all sins against God and man.\" And Bill said, \"So?\" And I said, \"So, you're six. You have a whole year to do anything\nyou want to and God won't notice it.\" And he said, \"So?\" And I said, \"So? So everything!\" And I turned to run.\nI was so angry with him. But when I got to the top of the steps, I turned around dramatically and said, \"Oh, by the way, Bill --\nthere is no Santa Claus.\" (Laughter) Now, I didn't know it at the time, but I really wasn't turning seven\non September 10th. For my 13th birthday, I planned a slumber party\nwith all of my girlfriends, but a couple of weeks beforehand\nmy mother took me aside and said, \"I need to speak to you privately. September 10th is not your birthday.\nIt's October 10th.\" And I said, \"What?\" (Laughter) And she said ... (Laughter) \"Listen. The cut-off date to start\nkindergarten was September 15th.\" (Laughter) \"So I told them that your birthday\nwas September 10th, and then I wasn't sure that you weren't just going to go\nblab it all over the place, so I started to tell you\nyour birthday was September 10th. But, Julie, you were so ready to start\nschool, honey. You were so ready.\" I thought about it, and when I was four, I was already the oldest of four children, and my mother even had\nanother child to come, so what I think she --\nunderstandably -- really meant was that she was so ready,\nshe was so ready. Then she said, \"Don't worry, Julie. Every year on October 10th, when it was your birthday\nbut you didn't realize it, I made sure that you ate\na piece of cake that day.\" (Laughter) Which was comforting, but troubling. My mother had been celebrating\nmy birthday with me, without me. (Laughter) What was so upsetting\nabout this new piece of information was not that I had to change\nthe date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends. What was most upsetting\nwas that this meant I was not a Virgo. I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom. And I read my horoscope every single day, and it was so totally me. (Laughter) And this meant that I was a Libra? So, I took the bus downtown\nto get the new Libra poster. The Virgo poster is a picture\nof a beautiful woman with long hair, sort of lounging by some water, but the Libra poster is just a huge scale. This was around the time\nthat I started filling out physically, and I was filling out a lot more\nthan a lot of the other girls, and frankly, the whole idea\nthat my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing. (Laughter) But I got the new Libra poster, and I started to read\nmy new Libra horoscope, and I was astonished to find\nthat it was also totally me. (Laughter) It wasn't until years later, looking back on this whole age-of-reason,\nchange-of-birthday thing, that it dawned on me: I wasn't turning seven\nwhen I thought I turned seven. I had a whole other month to do anything I wanted to\nbefore God started keeping tabs on me. Oh, life can be so cruel. One day, two Mormon\nmissionaries came to my door. Now, I just live off a main\nthoroughfare in Los Angeles, and my block is -- well,\nit's a natural beginning for people who are peddling\nthings door to door. Sometimes I get little old ladies\nfrom the Seventh Day Adventist Church showing me these cartoon\npictures of heaven. And sometimes I get\nteenagers who promise me that they won't join a gang\nand just start robbing people, if I only buy some\nmagazine subscriptions from them. So normally, I just ignore the doorbell,\nbut on this day, I answered. And there stood two boys, each about 19,\nin white, starched short-sleeved shirts, and they had little name tags that identified them\nas official representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ\nof Latter-day Saints, and they said they had\na message for me, from God. I said, \"A message for me? From God?\"\nAnd they said, \"Yes.\" Now, I was raised\nin the Pacific Northwest, around a lot of Church of Latter-day\nSaints people and, you know, I've worked with them and even dated them, but I never really knew the doctrine, or what they said to people\nwhen they were out on a mission, and I guess I was sort of curious,\nso I said, \"Well, please, come in.\" And they looked really happy, because I don't think this happens\nto them all that often. (Laughter) And I sat them down,\nand I got them glasses of water -- Ok, I got it, I got it. I got them glasses of water. Don't touch my hair, that's the thing. (Laughter) You can't put a video\nof myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair. Ok. (Laughter) So I sat them down\nand I got them glasses of water, and after niceties, they said, \"Do you believe that God loves you\nwith all his heart?\" And I thought, \"Well,\nof course I believe in God, but you know, I don't like\nthat word 'heart,' because it anthropomorphizes God, and I don't like the word, 'his,'\neither, because that sexualizes God.\" But I didn't want to argue\nsemantics with these boys, so after a very long,\nuncomfortable pause, I said, \"Yes, yes, I do. I feel very loved.\" And they looked at each other and smiled, like that was the right answer. And then they said, \"Do you believe that we're all brothers\nand sisters on this planet?\" And I said, \"Yes, I do.\" And I was so relieved that it was\na question I could answer so quickly. And they said, \"Well, then\nwe have a story to tell you.\" And they told me this story\nall about this guy named Lehi, who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC. Now, apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC,\neveryone was completely bad and evil. Every single one of them:\nman, woman, child, infant, fetus. And God came to Lehi and said to him, \"Put your family on a boat\nand I will lead you out of here.\" And God did lead them. He led them to America. I said, \"America? (Laughter) From Jerusalem to America\nby boat in 600 BC?\" And they said, \"Yes.\" (Laughter) Then they told me\nhow Lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced,\nand over the course of 600 years, there were two great races of them,\nthe Nephites and the Lamanites, and the Nephites were totally good --\neach and every one of them -- and the Lamanites\nwere totally bad and evil -- every single one of them\njust bad to the bone. Then, after Jesus died\non the cross for our sins, on his way up to heaven, he stopped by America\nand visited the Nephites. (Laughter) And he told them that if they all remained\ntotally, totally good -- each and every one of them -- they would win the war\nagainst the evil Lamanites. But apparently somebody blew it, because the Lamanites\nwere able to kill all the Nephites. All but one guy, this guy named Mormon, who managed to survive\nby hiding in the woods. And he made sure\nthis whole story was written down in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics\nchiseled onto gold plates, which he then buried\nnear Palmyra, New York. (Laughter) Well, I was just on the edge of my seat. (Laughter) I said, \"What happened to the Lamanites?\" And they said, \"Well, they became\nour Native Americans, here in the U.S.\" And I said, \"So, you believe\nthe Native Americans are descended from a people who were totally evil?\" And they said, \"Yes.\" Then they told me\nhow this guy named Joseph Smith found those buried gold plates\nright in his backyard, and he also found this magic stone\nback there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into, and this allowed him\nto translate the gold plates from the reformed Egyptian into English. Well, at this point I just wanted to give\nthese two boys some advice about their pitch. (Laughter) I wanted to say -- (Applause) \"Ok, don't start with this story.\" (Laughter) I mean, even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test\nbefore they start -- (Applause) telling people all about Xenu,\nthe evil intergalactic overlord. Then, they said, \"Do you believe\nthat God speaks to us through his righteous prophets?\" And I said, \"No, I don't,\" because I was sort of upset\nabout this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story, but the truth was,\nI hadn't really thought this through, so I backpedaled a little and I said, \"Well, what exactly\ndo you mean by 'righteous'? And what do you mean by prophets?\nLike, could the prophets be women?\" And they said, \"No.\" And I said, \"Why?\" And they said, \"Well, it's because\nGod gave women a gift that is so spectacular, it is so wonderful, that the only gift\nhe had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy.\" What is this wonderful gift\nGod gave women, I wondered? Maybe their greater ability\nto cooperate and adapt? (Laughter) Women's longer lifespan? The fact that women tend to be\nmuch less violent than men? But no -- it wasn't any of these gifts. They said, \"Well, it's her ability\nto bear children.\" I said, \"Oh, come on. I mean, even if women\ntried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15\nto the time they were 45, assuming they didn't die from exhaustion, it still seems like some women\nwould have some time left over to hear the word of God.\" And they said, \"No.\" (Laughter) Well, then they didn't look so\nfresh-faced and cute to me any more, but they had more to say. They said, \"Well, we also believe\nthat if you're a Mormon, and if you're in good standing\nwith the church, when you die, you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity.\" And I said, \"Oh, dear. (Laughter) That wouldn't be\nsuch a good incentive for me.\" (Laughter) And they said, \"Oh. (Laughter) Hey! Well, we also believe\nthat when you go to heaven, you get your body restored to you\nin its best original state. Like, if you'd lost a leg,\nwell, you get it back. Or, if you'd gone blind, you could see.\" I said, \"Oh. Now, I don't have a uterus, because I had cancer a few years ago. So does this mean\nthat if I went to heaven, I would get my old uterus back?\" And they said, \"Sure.\" And I said, \"I don't want it back.\nI'm happy without it.\" Gosh. What if you had a nose job\nand you liked it? (Laughter) Would God force you\nto get your old nose back? Then they gave me this Book of Mormon, told me to read\nthis chapter and that chapter, and said they'd come back\nand check in on me, and I think I said something\nlike, \"Please don't hurry,\" or maybe just, \"Please don't,\"\nand they were gone. Ok, so I initially felt\nreally superior to these boys, and smug in my more conventional faith. But then the more I thought about it,\nthe more I had to be honest with myself. If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology\nand dogma for the very first time, and they said, \"We believe that God\nimpregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse, and the fact that she was a virgin\nis maniacally important to us.\" (Laughter) \"And she had a baby,\nand that's the son of God,\" I mean, I would think\nthat's equally ridiculous. I'm just so used to that story. (Laughter) So, I couldn't let myself feel\ncondescending towards these boys. But the question they asked me\nwhen they first arrived really stuck in my head: Did I believe that God\nloved me with all his heart? Because I wasn't exactly sure\nhow I felt about that question. Now, if they had asked me, \"Do you feel that God loves\nyou with all his heart?\" Well, that would have been much different,\nI think I would have instantly answered, \"Yes, yes, I feel it all the time. I feel God's love\nwhen I'm hurt and confused, and I feel consoled and cared for. I take shelter in God's love when\nI don't understand why tragedy hits, and I feel God's love when I look\nwith gratitude at all the beauty I see.\" But since they asked me that question\nwith the word \"believe\" in it, somehow it was all different, because I wasn't exactly sure\nif I believed what I so clearly felt.",

        "transcript": "I'm going to present\nthree projects in rapid fire. I don't have much time to do it. And I want to reinforce three ideas\nwith that rapid-fire presentation. The first is what I like to call\na hyper-rational process. It's a process that takes rationality\nalmost to an absurd level, and it transcends all the baggage that normally comes\nwith what people would call, sort of a rational\nconclusion to something. And it concludes in something\nthat you see here, that you actually wouldn't expect\nas being the result of rationality. The second -- the second is that this process\ndoes not have a signature. There is no authorship. Architects are obsessed with authorship. This is something that has\nediting and it has teams, but in fact, we no longer\nsee within this process, the traditional master architect creating a sketch\nthat his minions carry out. And the third is that it challenges -- and this is, in the length of this,\nvery hard to support why, connect all these things -- but it challenges the high modernist\nnotion of flexibility. High modernists said we will create\nsort of singular spaces that are generic, almost anything can happen within them. I call it sort of \"shotgun flexibility\" -- turn your head this way; shoot;\nand you're bound to kill something. So, this is the promise of high modernism: within a single space, actually,\nany kind of activity can happen. But as we're seeing, operational costs are starting\nto dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters. And so, with this sort of idea, what happens is, whatever actually\nis in the building on opening day, or whatever seems to be\nthe most immediate need, starts to dwarf the possibility\nand sort of subsume it, of anything else could ever happen. And so we're proposing\na different kind of flexibility, something that we call\n\"compartmentalized flexibility.\" And the idea is that you,\nwithin that continuum, identify a series of points,\nand you design specifically to them. They can be pushed\noff-center a little bit, but in the end you actually\nstill get as much of that original spectrum\nas you originally had hoped. With high modernist flexibility,\nthat doesn't really work. Now I'm going to talk about -- I'm going to build up\nthe Seattle Central Library in this way before your eyes\nin about five or six diagrams, and I truly mean this is the design\nprocess that you'll see. With the library staff\nand the library board, we settled on two core positions. This is the first one, and this\nis showing, over the last 900 years, the evolution of the book,\nand other technologies. This diagram was our sort\nof position piece about the book, and our position was,\nbooks are technology -- that's something people forget -- but it's a form of technology\nthat will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent\ntechnology or media. The second premise -- and this was something\nthat was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first -- is that libraries, since the inception\nof Carnegie Library tradition in America, had a second responsibility,\nand that was for social roles. Ok, now, this I'll come back\nto later, but something -- actually, the librarians at first said,\n\"No, this isn't our mandate. Our mandate is media,\nand particularly the book.\" So what you're seeing now\nis actually the design of the building. The upper diagram is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries\nthat used high modernist flexibility. Sort of, any activity\ncould happen anywhere. We don't know the future of the library;\nwe don't know the future of the book; and so, we'll use this approach. And what we saw were buildings\nthat were very generic, and worse -- not only were they very generic -- so, not only does the reading room\nlook like the copy room look like the magazine area -- but it meant that whatever issue\nwas troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every other\nactivity that was happening in it. And in this case,\nwhat was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities\nby the expansion of the book. And so we proposed\nwhat's at the lower diagram. Very dumb approach:\nsimply compartmentalize. Put those things whose evolution\nwe could predict -- and I don't mean that we could say\nwhat would actually happen in the future, but we have some certainty of the spectrum\nof what would happen in the future -- put those in boxes designed\nspecifically for it, and put the things that we can't\npredict on the rooftops. So that was the core idea. Now, we had to convince the library that social roles were\nequally important to media, in order to get them to accept this. What you're seeing here is actually\ntheir program on the left. That's as it was given to us\nin all of its clarity and glory. Our first operation was to re-digest it\nback to them, show it to them and say, \"You know what? We haven't touched it, but only one-third of your own program\nis dedicated to media and books. Two-thirds of it is already dedicated -- that's the white band below,\nthe thing you said isn't important -- is already dedicated to social functions.\" So once we had presented\nthat back to them, they agreed that this sort\nof core concept could work. We got the right to go back\nto first principles -- that's the third diagram. We recombined everything. And then we started making new decisions. What you're seeing on the right\nis the design of the library, specifically in terms of square footage. On the left of that diagram, here,\nyou'll see a series of five platforms -- sort of combs, collective programs. And on the right are the more\nindeterminate spaces; things like reading rooms, whose evolution in 20, 30, 40 years\nwe can't predict. So that literally was the design\nof the building. They signed it, and to their chagrin, we came back a week later,\nand we presented them this. And as you can see, it is literally\nthe diagram on the right. (Laughter) We just sized -- no, really,\nI mean that, literally. The things on the left-hand side\nof the diagram, those are the boxes. We sized them into five compartments.\nThey're super-efficient. We had a very low budget to work with. We pushed them around on the site to make very literal\ncontextual relationships. The reading room\nshould be able to see the water. The main entrance should have\na public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code, and so forth. So, you see the five platforms,\nthose are the boxes. within each one, a very discrete\nthing is happening. The area in between\nis sort of an urban continuum, these things that we can't predict\ntheir evolution to the same degree. To give you some sense\nof the power of this idea, the biggest block\nis what we call the book spiral. It's literally built\nin a very inexpensive way -- it is a parking garage for books. It just so happens to be on the 6th\nthrough 10th floors of the building, but that is not necessarily\nan expensive approach. And it allows us to organize\nthe entire Dewey Decimal System on one continuous run; no matter how it\ngrows or contracts within the building, it will always have its clarity\nto end the sort of trail of tears that we've all experienced\nin public libraries. (Laughter) And so this was the final operation, which was to take these blocks\nas they were all pushed off kilter, and to hold onto them with a skin. That skin serves double duty,\nagain, for economics. One, it is the lateral stability\nfor the entire building; it's a structural element. But its dimensions were designed\nnot only for structure, but also for holding on\nevery piece of glass. The glass was then --\nI'll use the word impregnated -- but it had a layer of metal\nthat was called \"stretched metal.\" That metal acts as a microlouver, so from the exterior of the building,\nthe sun sees it as totally opaque, but from the interior,\nit's entirely transparent. So now I'm going to take you\non a tour of the building. Let me see if I can find it. For anyone who gets\nmotion sickness, I apologize. So, this is the building. And I think what's important is,\nwhen we first unveiled the building, the public saw it as being\ntotally about our whim and ego. And it was defended,\nbelieve it or not, by the librarians. They said, \"Look,\nwe don't know what it is, but we know it's everything\nthat we need it to be, based on the observations\nthat we've done about the program.\" This is going into one of the entries. So, it's an unusual building\nfor a public library, obviously. So now we're going\ninto what we call the living room. This is actually a program\nthat we invented with the library. It was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space. There are plenty of shopping malls\nthat allow you to get out of the rain in downtown Seattle, but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain. So this was an unprogrammed area where\npeople could pretty much do anything, including eat, yell,\nplay chess and so forth. Now we're moving up into what we call\nthe mixing chamber. That was the main\ntechnology area in the building. You'll have to tell me\nif I'm going too fast for you. And now up. This is actually the place\nthat we put into the building so I could propose\nto my wife, right there. (Laughter) She said yes. (Laughter) I'm running out of time,\nso I'm actually going to stop. I can show this to you later. But let's see if I can very quickly\nget into the book spiral, because I think it's,\nas I said, the most -- this is the main reading room --\nthe most unique part of the building. You dizzy yet? Ok, so here, this is the book spiral. So, it's very indiscernible, but it's actually\na continuous stair-stepping. It allows you to, on one city block, go up one full floor,\nso that it's on a continuum. Ok, now I'm going to go back,\nand I'm going to hit a second project. I'm going to go very,\nvery quickly through this. Now this is the Dallas Theater. It was an unusual client for us,\nbecause they came to us and they said, \"We need you to do a new building. We've been working\nin a temporary space for 30 years, but because of that temporary space, we've become an infamous theater company. Theater is really focused in New York,\nChicago and Seattle, with the exception\nof the Dallas Theater Company.\" And the very fact that they worked\nin a provisional space meant that for Beckett,\nthey could blow out a wall; they could do \"Cherry Orchard\" and blow\na hole through the floor, and so forth. So it was a very daunting task\nfor us to do a brand-new building that could be a pristine building, but keep this kind of experimental nature. And the second is, they were what we call\na multi-form theater, they do different kinds\nof performances in repertory. So they in the morning\nwill do something in arena, then they'll do something\nin proscenium and so forth. And so they needed to be able\nto quickly transform between different theater organizations, and for operational budget reasons, this actually no longer\nhappens in pretty much any multi-form theater\nin the United States, so we needed to figure out\na way to overcome that. So our thought was to literally\nput the theater on its head: to take those things\nthat were previously defined as front-of-house and back-of-house and stack them above house\nand below house, and to create what we called\na theater machine. We invest the money\nin the operation of the building. It's almost as though the building\ncould be placed anywhere, wherever you place it, the area under it is charged\nfor theatrical performances. And it allowed us to go back\nto first principles, and redefine fly tower, acoustic\nenclosure, light enclosure and so forth. And at the push of a button, it allows the artistic director\nto move between proscenium, thrust, and in fact, arena\nand traverse and flat floor, in a very quick transfiguration. So in fact, using\noperational budget, we can -- sorry, capital cost --\nwe can actually achieve what was no longer achievable\nin operational cost. And that means that the artistic director now has a palette that he or she\ncan choose from, between a series of forms\nand a series of processions, because that enclosure around the theater\nthat is normally trapped with front-of-house and back-of-house\nspaces has been liberated. So an artistic director has the ability\nto have a performance that enters in a Wagnerian procession, shows the first act in thrust, the intermission in a Greek procession, second act in arena, and so forth. So I'm going to show you\nwhat this actually means. This is the theater up close. Any portion around the theater\nactually can be opened discretely. The light enclosure can be lifted\nseparate to the acoustic enclosure, so you can do Beckett\nwith Dallas as the backdrop. Portions can be opened, so you can now actually have motorcycles\ndrive directly into the performance, or you can even just have\nan open-air performance, or for intermissions. The balconies all move to go\nbetween those configurations, but they also disappear. The proscenium line can also disappear. You can bring enormous objects in, so in fact, the Dallas Theater Company -- their first show will be a play\nabout Charles Lindbergh, and they'll want to bring in\na real aircraft. And then it also provides them,\nin the off-season, the ability to actually rent out\ntheir space for entirely different things. This is it from a distance. Open up entire portions\nfor different kinds of events. And at night. Again, remove the light enclosure;\nkeep the acoustic enclosure. This is a monster truck show. I'm going to show now the last project. This also is an unusual client. They inverted the whole idea\nof development. They came to us and they said --\nunlike normal developers -- they said, \"We want to start out by providing a contemporary\nart museum in Louisville. That's our main goal.\" And so instead of being a developer\nthat sees an opportunity to make money, they saw an ability to be\na catalyst in their downtown. And the fact that they wanted to support\nthe contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma, so they worked in reverse. And that pro forma led us to a mixed-use building\nthat was very large, in order to support\ntheir aspirations of the art, but it also opened up opportunities\nfor the art itself to collaborate, interact\nwith commercial spaces that actually artists more\nand more want to work within. And it also charged us\nwith thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of sub-building. So this is Louisville's skyline, and I'm going to take\nyou through the various constraints that led to the project. First: the physical constraints. We actually had to operate\non three discrete sites, all of them well smaller\nthan the size of the building. We had to operate next to the new\nMuhammad Ali Center, and respect it. We had to operate\nwithin the 100-year floodplain. Now, this area floods\nthree to four times a year, and there's a levee behind our site, similar to the ones\nthat broke in New Orleans. Had to operate behind the I-64 corridor, a street that cuts through the middle\nof these separate sites. So we're starting to build a sort of\nnightmare of constraints in a bathtub. Underneath the bathtub\nare the city's main power lines. And there is a pedestrian corridor\nthat they wanted to add, that would link a series\nof cultural buildings, and a view corridor --\nbecause this is the historic district -- that they didn't want to obstruct\nwith a new building. (Laughter) And now we're going to add\n1.1 million square feet. And if we did the traditional thing,\nthat 1.1 million square feet -- these are the different programs -- the traditional thing would be to identify\nthe public elements, place them on sites, and now we'd have a really\nterrible situation: a public thing in the middle\nof a bathtub that floods. And then we would size\nall the other elements -- the different commercial elements: hotel, luxury housing,\noffices and so forth -- and dump it on top. And we would create\nsomething that was unviable. In fact -- and you know this -- this\nis called the Time Warner Building. (Laughter) So our strategy was very simple. Just lift the entire block, flip some of the elements over, reposition them\nso they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown, and make circulation connections\nand reroute the road. So that's the basic concept, and now I'm going to show you\nwhat it leads to. Ok, it seems a very formal,\nwillful gesture, but something derived entirely\nout of the constraints. And again, when we unveiled it,\nthere was a sort of nervousness that this was about an architect\nmaking a statement, not an architect who was attempting\nto solve a series of problems. Now, within that center zone, as I said, we have the ability to mix\na series of things. So here, this is sort of an x-ray -- the towers are totally developer-driven. They told us the dimensions,\nthe sizes and so forth, and we focused on taking\nall the public components -- the lobbies, the bars -- everything that different commercial\nelements would have, and combined it in the center,\nin the sort of subway map, in the transfer zone that would also\ninclude the contemporary art museum. So it creates a situation like this,\nwhere you have artists who can operate within an art space that also has\nan amazing view on the 22nd floor, but it also has proximity that the curator\ncan either open or close. It allows people\non exercise bicycles to be seen, or to see the art, and so forth. It also means that if an artist wants\nto invade something like a swimming pool, they can begin to do their exhibition\nin a swimming pool, so they're not forced to always\nwork within the confines of a contemporary gallery space. So, how to build this. It's very simple: it's a chair. So, we begin by building the cores. As we're building the cores, we build\nthe contemporary art museum at grade. That allows us to have\nincredible efficiency and cost efficiency. This is not a high-budget building. The moment the cores get to mid level, we finish the art museum; we put\nall the mechanical equipment in it; and then we jack it up into the air. This is how they build\nreally large aircraft hangars, for instance, the ones\nthat they did for the A380. Finish the cores, finish the meat and you get something\nthat looks like this. Now I only have about 30 seconds, so I want to start an animation, and we'll conclude with that. Thank you. (Applause) Chris asked me to add -- the theater is under construction, and this project will start\nconstruction in about a year, and finish in 2010.

        "transcript": "It's wonderful to be back. I love this wonderful gathering. And you must be wondering, \"What on earth? Have they put up the wrong slide?\" No, no. Look at this magnificent beast, and ask the question: Who designed it? This is TED; this is\nTechnology, Entertainment, Design, and there's a dairy cow. It's a quite wonderfully designed animal. And I was thinking,\nhow do I introduce this? And I thought, well, maybe\nthat old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer, you know: \"Poems are made by fools\nlike me, but only God can make a tree.\" And you might say,\n\"Well, God designed the cow.\" But, of course, God got a lot of help. This is the ancestor of cattle. This is the aurochs. And it was designed by natural selection, the process of natural selection,\nover many millions of years. And then it became domesticated,\nthousands of years ago. And human beings became its stewards, and, without even knowing\nwhat they were doing, they gradually redesigned it\nand redesigned it and redesigned it. And then more recently, they really began\nto do reverse engineering on this beast and figure out just what\nthe parts were, how they worked and how they might be optimized --\nhow they might be made better. Now, why am I talking about cows? Because I want to say that\nmuch the same thing is true of religions. Religions are natural phenomena --\nthey're just as natural as cows. They have evolved over millennia. They have a biological base,\njust like the aurochs. They have become domesticated, and human beings have been redesigning\ntheir religions for thousands of years. This is TED, and I want\nto talk about design. Because what I've been doing\nfor the last four years -- really since the first time you saw me -- some of you saw me at TED\nwhen I was talking about religion -- and in the last four years, I've been working\njust about non-stop on this topic. And you might say it's about\nthe reverse engineering of religions. Now that very idea, I think,\nstrikes terror in many people, or anger, or anxiety\nof one sort or another. And that is the spell\nthat I want to break. I want to say, no, religions\nare an important natural phenomenon. We should study them\nwith the same intensity that we study all the other\nimportant natural phenomena, like global warming, as we heard\nso eloquently last night from Al Gore. Today's religions are brilliantly\ndesigned -- brilliantly designed. They are immensely powerful\nsocial institutions and many of their features\ncan be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of\nby reverse engineering. And, as with the cow, there's a mixture\nof evolutionary design -- designed by natural selection itself -- and intelligent design -- more or less intelligent design -- and redesigned by human beings who are trying\nto redesign their religions. You don't do book talks at TED, but I'm going to have\njust one slide about my book, because there is one message in it which I think this group\nreally needs to hear. And I would be very interested\nto get your responses to this. It's the one policy proposal\nthat I make in the book, at this time, when I claim\nnot to know enough about religion to know what other\npolicy proposals to make. And it's one that echoes remarks\nthat you've heard already today. Here's my proposal, I'm going to just take a couple\nof minutes to explain it: Education on world religions\nfor all of our children -- in primary school, in high school, in public schools, in private schools\nand in home schooling. So what I'm proposing is, just as we require reading, writing,\narithmetic, American history, so we should have a curriculum on facts\nabout all the religions of the world -- about their history,\nabout their creeds, about their texts, their music, their symbolisms,\ntheir prohibitions, their requirements. And this should be presented\nfactually, straightforwardly, with no particular spin,\nto all of the children in the country. And as long as you teach them that, you can teach them anything else you like. That, I think, is maximal tolerance\nfor religious freedom. As long as you inform your children\nabout other religions, then you may -- and as early as you like\nand whatever you like -- teach them whatever creed\nyou want them to learn. But also let them know\nabout other religions. Now, why do I say that? Because democracy depends\non an informed citizenship. Informed consent is the very bedrock\nof our understanding of democracy. Misinformed consent is not worth it. It's like a coin flip;\nit doesn't count, really. Democracy depends on informed consent. This is the way we treat people\nas responsible adults. Now, children below the age of consent\nare a special case. Parents -- I'm going to use a word\nthat Pastor Rick just used -- parents are stewards of their children. They don't own them. You can't own your children. You have a responsibility to the world, to the state, to them,\nto take care of them right. You may teach them whatever creed\nyou think is most important, but I say you have a responsibility\nto let them be informed about all the other creeds\nin the world, too. The reason I've taken this time\nis I've been fascinated to hear some of the reactions to this. One reviewer for a Roman Catholic\nnewspaper called it \"totalitarian.\" It strikes me as practically libertarian. Is it totalitarian to require\nreading, writing and arithmetic? I don't think so. All I'm saying is -- and facts, facts only;\nno values, just facts -- about all the world's religions. Another reviewer called it \"hilarious.\" Well, I'm really bothered by the fact that anybody would think\nthat was hilarious. It seems to me to be such a plausible, natural extension of the democratic\nprinciples we already have that I'm shocked to think anybody\nwould find that just ridiculous. I know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity\nof their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping\ntheir children ignorant of other faiths. I don't think that's defensible. But I'd really be pleased\nto get your answers on that -- any reactions to that -- later. But now I'm going to move on. Back to the cow. This picture, which I pulled\noff the web -- the fellow on the left is really\nan important part of this picture. That's the steward. Cows couldn't live without human\nstewards -- they're domesticated. They're a sort of ectosymbiont. They depend on us for their survival. And Pastor Rick\nwas just talking about sheep. I'm going to talk about sheep, too. There's a lot of serendipitous\nconvergence here. How clever it was of sheep\nto acquire shepherds! (Laughter) Think of what this got them. They could outsource all their problems: protection from predators,\nfood-finding ... (Laughter) ... health maintenance. (Laughter) The only cost in most flocks --\nnot even this -- a loss of free mating. What a deal! \"How clever of sheep!\" you might say. Except, of course,\nit wasn't the sheep's cleverness. We all know sheep are not exactly rocket\nscientists -- they're not very smart. It wasn't the cleverness\nof the sheep at all. They were clueless. But it was a very clever move. Whose clever move was it? It was the clever move\nof natural selection itself. Francis Crick, the co-discoverer\nof the structure of DNA with Jim Watson, once joked about what he called\nOrgel's Second Rule. Leslie Orgel is a molecular\nbiologist, brilliant guy, and Orgel's Second Rule is: Evolution is cleverer than you are. Now, that is not Intelligent Design --\nnot from Francis Crick. Evolution is cleverer than you are. If you understand Orgel's Second Rule,\nthen you understand why the Intelligent Design movement\nis basically a hoax. The designs discovered\nby the process of natural selection are brilliant, unbelievably brilliant. Again and again biologists are fascinated\nwith the brilliance of what's discovered. But the process itself is without purpose, without foresight, without design. When I was here four years ago, I told the story about an ant\nclimbing a blade of grass. And why the ant was doing it\nwas because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was needed\nto get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce. So it was sort of a spooky story. And I think some people\nmay have misunderstood. Lancet flukes aren't smart. I submit that the intelligence\nof a lancet fluke is down there, somewhere between petunia and carrot. They're not really bright.\nThey don't have to be. The lesson we learn from this is: you don't have to have a mind\nto be a beneficiary. The design is there in nature,\nbut it's not in anybody's head. It doesn't have to be. That's the way evolution works. Question: Was domestication\ngood for sheep? It was great for their genetic fitness. And here I want to remind you\nof a wonderful point that Paul MacCready made\nat TED three years ago. Here's what he said: \"Ten thousand years ago,\nat the dawn of agriculture, human population, plus livestock and pets, was approximately a tenth of one percent\nof the terrestrial vertebrate landmass.\" That was just 10,000 years ago. Yesterday, in biological terms. What is it today? Does anybody\nremember what he told us? 98 percent. That is what we have done on this planet. Now, I talked to Paul afterwards --\nI wanted to check to find out how he'd calculated this, and get\nthe sources and so forth -- and he also gave me a paper\nthat he had written on this. And there was a passage in it\nwhich he did not present here and I think it is so good,\nI'm going to read it to you: \"Over billions of years\non a unique sphere, chance has painted\na thin covering of life: complex, improbable,\nwonderful and fragile. Suddenly, we humans --\na recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks\nand balances inherent in nature -- have grown in population,\ntechnology and intelligence to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush.\" We heard about the atmosphere\nas a thin layer of varnish. Life itself is just a thin coat\nof paint on this planet. And we're the ones\nthat hold the paintbrush. And how can we do that? The key to our domination\nof the planet is culture. And the key to culture is religion. Suppose Martian scientists came to Earth. They would be puzzled by many things. Anybody know what this is?\nI'll tell you what it is. This is a million people gathering\non the banks of the Ganges in 2001, perhaps the largest single gathering\nof human beings ever, as seen from satellite photograph. Here's a big crowd. Here's another crowd in Mecca. Martians would be amazed by this. They'd want to know how it originated, what it was for\nand how it perpetuates itself. Actually, I'm going to pass over this. The ant isn't alone. There's all sorts of wonderful cases\nof species which -- in that case -- A parasite gets into a mouse\nand needs to get into the belly of a cat. And it turns the mouse\ninto Mighty Mouse, makes it fearless, so it runs out in the open,\nwhere it'll be eaten by a cat. True story. In other words, we have these hijackers -- you've seen this slide before,\nfrom four years ago -- a parasite that infects the brain\nand induces even suicidal behavior, on behalf of a cause\nother than one's own genetic fitness. Does that ever happen to us? Yes, it does -- quite wonderfully. The Arabic word \"Islam\"\nmeans \"submission.\" It means \"surrender of self-interest\nto the will of Allah.\" But I'm not just talking about Islam. I'm talking also about Christianity. This is a parchment music page\nthat I found in a Paris bookstall 50 years ago. And on it, it says, in Latin: \"Semen est verbum Dei.\nSator autem Christus.\" The word of God is the seed\nand the sower of the seed is Christ. Same idea. Well, not quite. But in fact, Christians, too ... glory in the fact\nthat they have surrendered to God. I'll give you a few quotes. \"The heart of worship is surrender. Surrendered people obey God's words,\neven if it doesn't make sense.\" Those words are by Rick Warren. Those are from \"The Purpose Driven Life.\" And I want to turn now, briefly,\nto talk about that book, which I've read. You've all got a copy, and you've just heard the man. And what I want to do now\nis say a bit about this book from the design standpoint, because I think it's actually\na brilliant book. First of all, the goal -- and you\nheard just now what the goal is -- it's to bring purpose to the lives\nof millions, and he has succeeded. Is it a good goal? In itself, I'm sure\nwe all agree, it is a wonderful goal. He's absolutely right. There are lots of people out there\nwho don't have purpose in their life, and bringing purpose to their life\nis a wonderful goal. I give him an A+ on this. (Laughter) Is the goal achieved? Yes. Thirty million copies of this book. Al Gore, eat your heart out. (Laughter) Just exactly what Al is trying\nto do, Rick is doing. This is a fantastic achievement. And the means -- how does he do it? It's a brilliant redesign\nof traditional religious themes -- updating them, quietly dropping\nobsolete features, putting new interpretations\non other features. This is the evolution of religion that's\nbeen going on for thousands of years, and he's just the latest\nbrilliant practitioner of it. I don't have to tell you this;\nyou just heard the man. Excellent insights into human psychology,\nwise advice on every page. Moreover, he invites us\nto look under the hood. I really appreciated that. For instance, he has an appendix\nwhere he explains his choice of translations\nof different Bible verses. The book is clear, vivid, accessible,\nbeautifully formatted. Just enough repetition. That's really important. Every time you read it or say it,\nyou make another copy in your brain. Every time you read it or say it,\nyou make another copy in your brain. (Laughter) With me, everybody -- (Audience and Dan Dennett)\nEvery time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain. Thank you. And now we come to my problem. Because I'm absolutely sincere\nin my appreciation of all that I said about this book. But I wish it were better. I have some problems with the book. And it would just be insincere of me\nnot to address those problems. I wish he could do this with a revision, a Mark 2 version of his book. \"The truth will set you free.\" That's what it says in the Bible, and it's something\nthat I want to live by, too. My problem is, some of the bits in it\nI don't think are true. Now some of this\nis a difference of opinion. And that's not my main complaint,\nthat's worth mentioning. Here's a passage -- it's very much\nwhat he said, anyway: \"If there was no God\nwe would all be accidents, the result of astronomical\nrandom chance in the Universe. You could stop reading this book\nbecause life would have no purpose or meaning or significance. There would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond\nyour brief years on Earth.\" Now, I just do not believe that. By the way, I find -- Homer Groening's\nfilm presented a beautiful alternative to that very claim. Yes, there is meaning and a reason\nfor right or wrong. We don't need a belief in God\nto be good or to have meaning in us. But that, as I said,\nis just a difference of opinion. That's not what I'm really worried about. How about this: \"God designed\nthis planet's environment just so we could live in it.\" I'm afraid that a lot of people\ntake that sentiment to mean that we don't have to do\nthe sorts of things that Al Gore is trying so hard\nto get us to do. I am not happy with that sentiment at all. And then I find this: \"All the evidence\navailable in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that\nthe cosmos is a specially designed whole with life and mankind\nas its fundamental goal and purpose, a whole in which all facets\nof reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact.\" Well, that's Michael Denton.\nHe's a creationist. And here, I think, \"Wait a minute.\"\nI read this again. I read it three or four times and I think, \"Is he really endorsing\nIntelligent Design? Is he endorsing creationism here?\" And you can't tell. So I'm sort of thinking,\n\"Well, I don't know, I don't know if I want\nto get upset with this yet.\" But then I read on, and I read this:\n\"First, Noah had never seen rain, because prior to the Flood, God irrigated\nthe earth from the ground up.\" I wish that sentence weren't in there,\nbecause I think it is false. And I think that thinking this way\nabout the history of the planet, after we've just been hearing\nabout the history of the planet over millions of years, discourages people\nfrom scientific understanding. Now, Rick Warren uses scientific terms and scientific factoids and information\nin a very interesting way. Here's one: \"God deliberately shaped\nand formed you to serve him in a way that makes your ministry unique. He carefully mixed the DNA cocktail\nthat created you.\" I think that's false. Now, maybe we want to treat it\nas metaphorical. Here's another one: \"For instance,\nyour brain can store 100 trillion facts. Your mind can handle\n15,000 decisions a second.\" Well, it would be interesting\nto find the interpretation where I would accept that. There might be some way\nof treating that as true. \"Anthropologists have noted\nthat worship is a universal urge, hardwired by God into\nthe very fiber of our being -- an inbuilt need to connect with God.\" Well, the sense of which I agree with him, except I think it has\nan evolutionary explanation. And what I find\ndeeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing\nthat if you want to be moral, if you want to have meaning in your life, you have to be an Intelligent Designer, you have to deny the theory of evolution\nby natural selection. And I think, on the contrary, that it is very important\nto solving the world's problems that we take evolutionary\nbiology seriously. Whose truth are we going to listen to? Well, this is from\n\"The Purpose Driven Life\": \"The Bible must become\nthe authoritative standard for my life: the compass I rely on for direction, the counsel I listen to\nfor making wise decisions, and the benchmark I use\nfor evaluating everything.\" Well maybe, OK, but what's going\nto follow from this? And here's one that does concern me. Remember I quoted him\nbefore with this line: \"Surrendered people obey God's word,\neven if it doesn't make sense.\" And that's a problem. (Sighs) \"Don't ever argue with the Devil. He's better at arguing than you are, having had thousands\nof years to practice.\" Now, Rick Warren\ndidn't invent this clever move. It's an old move. It's a very clever\nadaptation of religions. It's a wild card for disarming\nany reasonable criticism. \"You don't like my interpretation? You've got a reasonable objection to it? Don't listen, don't listen! That's the Devil speaking.\" This discourages the sort\nof reasoning citizenship it seems to me that we want to have. I've got one more problem,\nthen I'm through. And I'd really like to get\na response if Rick is able to do it. \"In the Great Commission, Jesus said, 'Go to all people of all nations\nand make them my disciples. Baptize them in the name of the Father,\nthe Son and the Holy Spirit, and teach them to do\neverything I've told you.'\" The Bible says Jesus is the only one\nwho can save the world. We've seen many wonderful maps\nof the world in the last day or so. Here's one, not as beautiful\nas the others; it simply shows\nthe religions of the world. Here's one that shows the sort of current\nbreakdown of the different religions. Do we really want to commit ourselves to engulfing all the other religions, when their holy books are telling them, \"Don't listen to the other side,\nthat's just Satan talking!\"? It seems to me that\nthat's a very problematic ship to get on for the future. I found this sign as I was driving\nto Maine recently, in front of a church:\n\"Good without God becomes zero.\" Sort of cute. A very clever little meme. I don't believe it and I think this idea,\npopular as it is -- not in this guise, but in general -- is itself one of the main\nproblems that we face. If you are like me, you know\nmany wonderful, committed, engaged atheists, agnostics, who are being\nvery good without God. And you also know many religious people\nwho hide behind their sanctity instead of doing good works. So, I wish we could drop this meme. I wish this meme would go extinct. Thanks very much for your attention. (Applause)"

        "transcript": "I'm often asked, \"What surprised you about the book?\" And I say, \"That I got to write it.\" I would have never imagined that. Not in my wildest dreams did I think -- I don't even consider\nmyself to be an author. And I'm often asked, \"Why do you think so many\npeople have read this? This thing's selling still\nabout a million copies a month.\" And I think it's because\nspiritual emptiness is a universal disease. I think inside at some point, we put\nour heads down on the pillow and we go, \"There's got to be more\nto life than this.\" Get up in the morning, go to work,\ncome home and watch TV, go to bed, get up in the morning, go\nto work, come home, watch TV, go to bed, go to parties on weekends. A lot of people say, \"I'm living.\" No,\nyou're not living -- that's just existing. Just existing. I really think that\nthere's this inner desire. I do believe what Chris said;\nI believe that you're not an accident. Your parents may not have planned you,\nbut I believe God did. I think there are accidental parents;\nthere's no doubt about that. I don't think there are accidental kids. And I think you matter. I think you matter to God;\nI think you matter to history; I think you matter to this universe. And I think that the difference between what I call the survival level\nof living, the success level of living, and the significance level of living is: Do you figure out,\n\"What on Earth am I here for?\" I meet a lot of people who are very smart, and say, \"But why can't I\nfigure out my problems?\" And I meet a lot of people\nwho are very successful, who say, \"Why don't I feel more fulfilled? Why do I feel like a fake? Why do I feel like I've got to pretend\nthat I'm more than I really am?\" I think that comes down to this issue\nof meaning, of significance, of purpose. I think it comes down to this issue of: \"Why am I here? What am I here for?\nWhere am I going?\" These are not religious issues. They're human issues. I wanted to tell Michael before he spoke\nthat I really appreciate what he does, because it makes my life work\na whole lot easier. As a pastor, I do see a lot of kooks. And I have learned that there are\nkooks in every area of life. Religion doesn't have a monopoly on that, but there are plenty of religious kooks. There are secular kooks;\nthere are smart kooks, dumb kooks. There are people -- a lady\ncame up to me the other day, and she had a white piece of paper --\nMichael, you'll like this one -- and she said, \"What do you see in it?\" And I looked at it and I said,\n\"Oh, I don't see anything.\" And she goes, \"Well, I see Jesus,\"\nand started crying and left. I'm going, \"OK,\" you know? \"Fine.\" (Laughter) Good for you. When the book became the best-selling book\nin the world for the last three years, I kind of had my little crisis. And that was: What is the purpose of this? Because it brought in\nenormous amounts of money. When you write the best-selling\nbook in the world, it's tons and tons of money. And it brought in a lot of attention,\nneither of which I wanted. When I started Saddleback Church,\nI was 25 years old. I started it with\none other family in 1980. And I decided that I was never\ngoing to go on TV, because I didn't want to be a celebrity. I didn't want to be a, quote,\n\"evangelist, televangelist\" -- that's not my thing. And all of the sudden, it brought a lot\nof money and a lot of attention. I don't think -- now, this is a worldview, and I will tell you,\neverybody's got a worldview. Everybody's betting\ntheir life on something. You're betting your life on something, you just better know why\nyou're betting what you're betting on. So, everybody's betting\ntheir life on something. And when I, you know, made a bet, I happened to believe\nthat Jesus was who he said he was. And I believe in a pluralistic society, everybody's betting on something. And when I started the church, you know, I had no plans\nto do what it's doing now. And then when I wrote this book, and all of a sudden, it just took off, and I started saying, now,\nwhat's the purpose of this? Because as I started to say, I don't think you're given money or fame for your own ego, ever. I just don't believe that. And when you write a book\nthat the first sentence of the book is, \"It's not about you,\" then, when all of a sudden it becomes\nthe best-selling book in history, you've got to figure, well,\nI guess it's not about me. That's kind of a no-brainer. So, what is it for? And I began to think about what I call\nthe \"stewardship of affluence\" and the \"stewardship of influence.\" So I believe, essentially,\nleadership is stewardship. That if you are a leader in any area -- in business, in politics,\nin sports, in art, in academics, in any area -- you don't own it. You are a steward of it. For instance, that's why I believe\nin protecting the environment. This is not my planet. It wasn't mine before I was born,\nit's not going to be mine after I die, I'm just here for 80 years\nand then that's it. I was debating\nthe other day on a talk show, and the guy was challenging\nme and he'd go, \"What's a pastor doing\non protecting the environment?\" And I asked this guy, I said,\n\"Well, do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better\nplace for the next generation? Do you think we have a stewardship here,\nto take the environment seriously?\" And he said, \"No.\" I said, \"Oh, you don't?\" I said, \"Let me make this clear again: Do you believe that as human beings --\nI'm not talking about religion -- do you believe that as human beings,\nit is our responsibility to take care of this planet, and make it just a little bit better\nfor the next generation?\" And he said, \"No. Not any more\nthan any other species.\" When he said the word \"species,\"\nhe was revealing his worldview. And he was saying, \"I'm no more responsible to take care\nof this environment than a duck is.\" Well now, I know a lot\nof times we act like ducks, but you're not a duck. You're not a duck. And you are responsible --\nthat's my worldview. And so, you need to understand\nwhat your worldview is. The problem is most people\nnever really think it through. They never really ... codify it or qualify it or quantify it, and say, \"This is what I believe in.\nThis is why I believe what I believe.\" I don't personally have\nenough faith to be an atheist. But you may, you may. Your worldview, though, does determine\neverything else in your life, because it determines your decisions; it determines your relationships; it determines your level of confidence. It determines, really,\neverything in your life. What we believe, obviously -- and you know this --\ndetermines our behavior, and our behavior determines\nwhat we become in life. So all of this money started pouring in, and all of this fame started pouring in. And I'm going, what do I do with this? My wife and I first made five decisions\non what to do with the money. We said, \"First, we're not\ngoing to use it on ourselves.\" I didn't go out and buy a bigger house. I don't own a guesthouse. I still drive the same four year-old\nFord that I've driven. We just said, we're not\ngoing to use it on us. The second thing was, I stopped taking a salary\nfrom the church that I pastor. Third thing is, I added up\nall that the church had paid me over the last 25 years,\nand I gave it back. And I gave it back because\nI didn't want anybody thinking that I do what I do for money -- I don't. In fact, personally, I've never met a priest or a pastor or a minister\nwho does it for money. I know that's the stereotype;\nI've never met one of them. Believe me, there's a whole lot\neasier ways to make money. Pastors are like on 24 hours-a-day call,\nthey're like doctors. I left late today -- I'd hoped\nto be here yesterday -- because my father-in-law\nis in his last, probably, 48 hours before he dies of cancer. And I'm watching a guy\nwho's lived his life -- he's now in his mid-80s --\nand he's dying with peace. You know, the test of your worldview\nis not how you act in the good times. The test of your worldview\nis how you act at the funeral. And having been through literally\nhundreds if not thousands of funerals, it makes a difference. It makes a difference what you believe. So, we gave it all back, and then we set up three foundations, working on some of the major\nproblems of the world: illiteracy, poverty, pandemic diseases --\nparticularly HIV/AIDS -- and set up these three foundations,\nand put the money into that. The last thing we did is we became\nwhat I call \"reverse tithers.\" And that is, when my wife\nand I got married 30 years ago, we started tithing. Now, that's a principle in the Bible that says give 10 percent\nof what you get back to charity, give it away to help other people. So, we started doing that, and each year\nwe would raise our tithe one percent. So, our first year of marriage\nwe went to 11 percent, second year we went to 12 percent, and the third year we went to 13 percent, and on and on and on. Why did I do that? Because every time I give, it breaks the grip\nof materialism in my life. Materialism is all about getting --\nget, get, get, get all you can, can all you get, sit on the can\nand spoil the rest. It's all about more, having more. And we think that the good life\nis actually looking good -- that's most important of all -- looking good, feeling good\nand having the goods. But that's not the good life. I meet people all the time who have\nthose, and they're not necessarily happy. If money actually made you happy, then the wealthiest people\nin the world would be the happiest. And that I know, personally,\nI know, is not true. It's just not true. So, the good life is not about looking\ngood, feeling good or having the goods, it's about being good and doing good. Giving your life away. Significance in life\ndoesn't come from status, because you can always find\nsomebody who's got more than you. It doesn't come from sex. It doesn't come from salary. It comes from serving. It is in giving our lives away\nthat we find meaning, we find significance. That's the way we were wired,\nI believe, by God. And so we began to give away, and now after 30 years, my wife and I are reverse tithers --\nwe give away 90 percent and live on 10. That, actually, was the easy part. The hard part is, what do I do\nwith all this attention? Because I started getting\nall kinds of invitations. I just came off a nearly\nmonth-long speaking tour on three different continents, and I won't go into that, but it was an amazing thing. And I'm going, what do I do\nwith this notoriety that the book has brought? And, being a pastor,\nI started reading the Bible. There's a chapter in the Bible\ncalled Psalm 72, and it's Solomon's prayer\nfor more influence. When you read this prayer, it sounds incredibly\nselfish, self-centered. He says, \"God, I want you\nto make me famous.\" That's what he prays. He said, \"I want you to make me famous. I want you to spread the fame\nof my name through every land, I want you to give me power. I want you to make me famous,\nI want you to give me influence.\" And it just sounds like the most\negotistical request you could make, if you were going to pray. Until you read the whole psalm,\nthe whole chapter. And then he says,\n\"So that the king ...\" -- he was the king of Israel\nat that time, at its apex in power -- \"... so that the king may care\nfor the widow and orphan, support the oppressed, defend\nthe defenseless, care for the sick, assist the poor,\nspeak up for the foreigner, those in prison.\" Basically, he's talking about\nall the marginalized in society. And as I read that, I looked at it, and I thought, you know, what this is saying is that the purpose\nof influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. The purpose of influence\nis not to build your ego. Or your net worth. And, by the way, your net worth is not\nthe same thing as your self-worth. Your value is not based on your valuables. It's based on a whole\ndifferent set of things. And so the purpose\nof influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. And I had to admit: I can't think of the last time\nI thought of widows and orphans. They're not on my radar. I pastor a church in one of the most\naffluent areas of America -- a bunch of gated communities. I have a church full\nof CEOs and scientists. And I could go five years and never,\never see a homeless person. They're just not in my pathway. Now, they're 13 miles\nup the road in Santa Ana. So I had to say, ok, I would use whatever affluence\nand whatever influence I've got to help those who don't have\neither of those. You know, there's a story\nin the Bible about Moses, whether you believe it's true or not,\nit really doesn't matter to me. But Moses, if you saw the movie,\n\"The Ten Commandments,\" Moses goes out, and there's this\nburning bush, and God talks to him, and God says,\n\"Moses, what's in your hand?\" I think that's one of the most important\nquestions you'll ever be asked: What's in your hand? Moses says, \"It's a staff.\nIt's a shepherd's staff.\" And God says, \"Throw it down.\" And if you saw the movie, you know,\nhe throws it down and it becomes a snake. And then God says, \"Pick it up.\" And he picks it back up again, and it becomes a staff again. Now, I'm reading this thing,\nand I'm going, what is that all about? OK. What's that all about? Well,\nI do know a couple of things. Number one, God never does\na miracle to show off. It's not just, \"Wow, isn't that cool?\" And, by the way, my God doesn't\nhave to show up on cheese bread. You know, if God's going to show up,\nhe's not going to show up on cheese bread. (Laughter) Ok? I just, this is why I love\nwhat Michael does, because it's like, if he's debunking it,\nthen I don't have to. But God -- my God --\ndoesn't show up on sprinkler images. He's got a few more powerful ways\nthan that to do whatever he wants to do. But he doesn't do miracles\njust to show off. Second thing is,\nif God ever asks you a question, he already knows the answer. Obviously, if he's God,\nthen that would mean that when he asks the question,\nit's for your benefit, not his. So he's going, \"What's in your hand?\" Now, what was in Moses' hand? Well, it was a shepherd's staff.\nNow, follow me on this. This staff represented\nthree things about Moses' life. First, it represented his identity;\nhe was a shepherd. It's the symbol of his own occupation: I am a shepherd. It's a symbol of his identity,\nhis career, his job. Second, it's a symbol\nof not only his identity, it's a symbol of his income, because all\nof his assets are tied up in sheep. In those days, nobody had bank accounts,\nor American Express cards, or hedge funds. Your assets are tied up in your flocks. So it's a symbol of his identity,\nand it's a symbol of his income. And the third thing:\nit's a symbol of his influence. What do you do with a shepherd's staff? Well, you know, you move sheep\nfrom point A to point B with it, by hook or by crook. You pull them or you poke them.\nOne or the other. So, he's saying, \"You're going to lay down your identity. What's in your hand? You've got identity, you've got income,\nyou've got influence. What's in your hand?\" And he's saying, \"If you lay it down,\nI'll make it come alive. I'll do some things\nyou could never imagine possible.\" And if you've watched that movie,\n\"Ten Commandments,\" all of those big miracles that happen\nin Egypt are done through this staff. Last year, I was invited to speak\nat the NBA All-Stars game. And so, I'm talking to the players, because most of the NBA teams,\nNFL teams and all the other teams have done this 40 Days of Purpose,\nbased on the book. And I asked them, I said,\n\"What's in your hand? So, what's in your hand?\"\nI said, \"It's a basketball. And that basketball represents\nyour identity, who you are: you're an NBA player. It represents your income: you're making a lot of money\noff that little ball. And it represents your influence. And even though you're only going\nto be in the NBA for a few years, you're going to be an NBA player\nfor the rest of your life. And that gives you enormous influence. So, what are you going to do\nwith what you've been given?\" And I guess that's the main reason\nI came up here today, to all of you very bright people at TED -- it is to say, \"What's in your hand?\" What do you have that you've been given? Talent, background, education, freedom, networks, opportunities, wealth, ideas, creativity. What are you doing\nwith what you've been given? That, to me, is the primary\nquestion about life. That, to me, is what being\npurpose-driven is all about. In the book, I talk about\nhow you're wired to do certain things, you're \"SHAPED\" with -- a little acrostic:\nSpiritual gifts, Heart, Ability, Personality and Experiences. These things shape you. And if you want to know what you ought\nto be doing with your life, you need to look at your shape --\n\"What am I wired to do?\" Why would God wire you to do something\nand then not have you do it? If you're wired to be an anthropologist,\nyou'll be an anthropologist. If you're wired to be\nan undersea explorer, you'll be an undersea explorer. If you're wired to make deals,\nyou make deals. If you're wired to paint, you paint. Did you know that God smiles\nwhen you be you? When my little kids --\nwhen my kids were little -- they're all grown now, I have grandkids -- I used to go in and sit\non the side of their bed, and I used to watch my kids sleep. And I just watched their little bodies\nrise and lower, rise and lower. And I would look at them:\n\"This is not an accident.\" Rise and lower. And I got joy out of just\nwatching them sleep. Some people have the misguided idea\nthat God only gets excited when you're doing, quote,\n\"spiritual things,\" like going to church or helping the poor, or, you know, confessing\nor doing something like that. The bottom line is, God gets pleasure\nwatching you be you. Why? He made you. And when you do what you were made to do, he goes, \"That's my boy! That's my girl! You're using the talent\nand ability that I gave you.\" So my advice to you is: look at what's in your hand -- your identity, your influence,\nyour income -- and say, \"It's not about me. It's about making the world\na better place.\" Thank you.",

                "I was seeking for my life purpose since 8 years old. I started to talk to God because I was bullied at school and started to have suicidal thoughts. I cried out, I scolded God and I also blamed God why He allowed all the bullying and rejection in my life. I talked to God almost every day. I found strength coming within although I was a Buddhist. \n\nIn end of 2014, my life hits rock bottom. I made so many mistakes and bad choices in life which I resigned my job thinking to be with someone I met online which in the end it was a scam. I was jobless and hopeless. I called out to all the God or Goddess I used to worship and I even called out to other God I can call their names including Allah and Jesus although I did not know them. I asked who was the God I used to talk to, I used to get angry with and I used to blame. But this God still helped me to stand up again and again. I asked this one true God to reveal. If there\u2019s a true God, please reveal to me.\n\nIn January 2015 I had a dream about a man in white robe. I remembered seeing the man in white robe and his robe was so white and bright. I didn't bother to look at his face as his hand was holding my hand and he took me to walk around the ancient city. I also saw few men in light brown robe walking behind us. I felt so calm and peaceful walking with the man in white robe. \n\nI woke up feeling very good as I just walked in ancient city but I did not understand my dream at all. In the same month, I also dreamt about satan in my dream. The black transparent shadow in a well-built man form. He was touching my neck until my chest from behind. I felt something evil. I tried so hard to wake up from my dream after I managed to open my eyes, I realized I can\u2019t move my body. I shouted for help but there\u2019s no voice coming out. \n\nWhen I managed to move my body I ran out from my bedroom then I saw the black shadow stood near my living room looking at me. It was the same devil I saw in my dream. I shouted for help from my mom and sis. Then they opened their bedroom door then the black transparent shadow disappeared immediately. I opened my bedroom door and I couldn\u2019t sleep although I let the light on until the next morning. I was so traumatized. I never encountered this in my life before. I thought it was ghost as I was a Buddhist that time. \n\n3 months later in mid-April, one morning I asked God how long I have to wait to understand my life purpose. I suddenly thought of a college friend whom I didn\u2019t contact for 16 years. I found her in Facebook. She invited me to church and I agreed to follow her to church as I was seeking for my life purpose. Before this, I approached numerology, astrology, tarot card reading, psychic medium to find out about my life purpose but it did not make me understand, it actually caused me to make so many bad choices and mistakes in life. \n\nAfter 2 Sunday services, I came home to look for a movie about Jesus Christ. I saw Jesus was wearing white robe in the movie and few of his disciples were in light brown robe then I suddenly recalled about the dream I had in January 2015. But I told myself not to be too emotional or jump to conclusion too fast. There was one scene when Jesus was standing at the mountain top then, Jesus began to shine with bright rays of light when God and Prophets Moses and Elijah appeared speaking to Him. I talked to myself that was the man I saw in my dream as his robe was so white and bright. But I tried to keep cool and reminded myself not to be too over excited.\n\nI watched the other half of the movie next day. I continued to watch without thinking too much about my dream but when the movie came toward the end, Jesus was carrying a cross to walk around the ancient city, I was stunned as I saw what I was seeing in my dream in January and I cried out very loud and uncontrollably. My mom and sis thought what was happening to me. I told them Jesus came into my dream and I was sure Jesus was the man in white robe who revealed to me in my dream then I was guided to church 3 months later. \n\nJesus tried to reveal to me by arranging my college friend to meet up with me and took me to church. If not I will not know Him. After that, I been through few spiritual attacks which I encountered with satan in spirit in all attacks I called out to Jesus Christ's name:\"In the name of Jesus Christ, I cast all the evil out.\" Then everything back to normal. I was stunned as I never experienced the power of Jesus Christ's name until I experienced it myself in a foreign land in Sri Lanka and also in dream and reality satan is attacking those who finds out the truth and who comes to know the one true God through Jesus Christ.\n\nI used my 9 months of jobless period to experience God through Jesus Christ. Then God has put in a desire and confident in me to seek for a job I wanted to do but always have no confident to do in training. With God's grace I got myself a career change and working as a soft skills trainer. I started to tell people about God through Jesus Christ.\n\nI wanted to help people with suicidal thoughts but satan came to stop me. I called out to Jesus Christ's name. God and satan both exist. Please get to know God through Jesus Christ, seek the truth, learn about God's words in Bible then you will learn about your true life purpose.": {

        "transcript": "I'm going to take you\non a journey very quickly. To explain the wish, I'm going\nto have to take you somewhere where many people haven't been,\nand that's around the world. When I was about 24 years old, Kate Stohr\nand myself started an organization to get architects and designers\ninvolved in humanitarian work, not only about responding\nto natural disasters, but involved in systemic issues. We believe that where the resources\nand expertise are scarce, innovative, sustainable design can really\nmake a difference in people's lives. So I started my life as an architect,\nor training as an architect, and I was always interested\nin socially responsible design, and how you can really make an impact. But when I went to architecture school, it seemed that I was\na black sheep in the family. Many architects seemed to think\nthat when you design, you design a jewel, and it's a jewel\nthat you try and crave for; whereas I felt that when you design, you either improve\nor you create a detriment to the community\nin which you're designing. So you're not just doing\na building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it,\nbut for the community as a whole. And in 1999, we started by responding\nto the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in Kosovo. And I didn't know what I was doing --\nlike I said, mid-20s -- and I'm the Internet generation,\nso we started a website. We put a call out there,\nand to my surprise, in a couple of months, we had hundreds of entries\nfrom around the world. That led to a number\nof prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas. Two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics\nin sub-Saharan Africa, responding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. That led to 550 entries from 53 countries. We also have designers\nfrom around the world that participate. And we had an exhibit\nof work that followed that. 2004 was the tipping point for us. We started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in Iran, in Bam, also following up on our work in Africa. Working within the United States -- most people look at poverty\nand they see the face of a foreigner. But I live in Bozeman, Montana -- go up to the north plains\non the reservations, or go down to Alabama\nor Mississippi, pre-Katrina, and I could have shown you\nplaces that have far worse conditions than many developing countries\nthat I've been to. So we got involved in and worked\nin inner cities and elsewhere; and also, I will go into\nsome more projects. 2005: Mother Nature kicked our ass. I think we can pretty much assume\nthat 2005 was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters. And because of the Internet, and because of connections\nto blogs and so forth, within literally hours of the tsunami,\nwe were already raising funds, getting involved, working\nwith people on the ground. We run from a couple of laptops,\nand in the first couple of days, I had 4,000 emails\nfrom people needing help. So we began to get involved\nin projects there, and I'll talk about some others. And then of course, this year\nwe've been responding to Katrina, as well as following up\non our reconstruction work. So this is a brief overview. In 2004, I really couldn't manage\nthe number of people who wanted to help, or the number of requests\nthat I was getting. It was all coming\ninto my laptop and cell phone. So we decided to embrace\nan open-source model of business -- so that anyone, anywhere in the world,\ncould start a local chapter, and they can get involved\nin local problems. Because I believe there\nis no such thing as Utopia. All problems are local.\nAll solutions are local. So that means, you know,\nsomebody who's based in Mississippi knows more about Mississippi than I do. So what happened is, we used Meetup\nand all these other Internet tools, and we ended up having\n40 chapters starting up, thousands of architects in 104 countries. So the bullet point --\nsorry, I never do a suit, so I knew that I was going\nto take this off. OK, because I'm going to do it very quick. This isn't just about nonprofit. What it showed me is that\nthere's a grassroots movement going on, of socially responsible designers\nwho really believe that this world has got a lot smaller,\nand that we have the opportunity -- not the responsibility,\nbut the opportunity -- to really get involved in making change. (Laughter) (Laughter) I'm adding that to my time. (Laughter) So what you don't know is, we've got these thousands of designers\nworking around the world, connected basically by a website,\nand we have a staff of three. The fact that nobody told us\nwe couldn't do it, we did it. And so there's something\nto be said about na\u00efvet\u00e9. So seven years later, we've developed so that we've got advocacy,\ninstigation and implementation. We advocate for good design,\nnot only through student workshops and lectures and public forums, op-eds; we have a book on humanitarian work; but also disaster mitigation\nand dealing with public policy. We can talk about FEMA,\nbut that's another talk. Instigation, developing ideas\nwith communities and NGOs, doing open-source design competitions. Referring, matchmaking with communities. And then implementing -- actually\ngoing out there and doing the work, because when you invent,\nit's never a reality until it's built. So it's really important\nthat if we're designing and trying to create change,\nwe build that change. So here's a select number of projects. Kosovo. This is Kosovo in '99. We did an open design\ncompetition, like I said. It led to a whole variety of ideas. And this wasn't about emergency shelter, but transitional shelter\nthat would last five to 10 years, that would be placed next to the land\nthe resident lived in, and that they would rebuild\ntheir own home. This wasn't imposing\nan architecture on a community; this was giving them\nthe tools and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow\nthe way they want to. We had from the sublime\nto the ridiculous, but they worked. This is an inflatable hemp house.\nIt was built; it works. This is a shipping container. Built and works. And a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with\narchitectural building, but also the issues of governance, and the idea of creating communities\nthrough complex networks. So we've engaged not just designers, but also a whole variety\nof technology-based professionals. Using rubble from destroyed homes\nto create new homes. Using straw bale construction,\ncreating heat walls. And then something remarkable\nhappened in '99. We went to Africa originally\nto look at the housing issue. Within three days, we realized\nthe problem was not housing; it was the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS. And it wasn't doctors telling us this; it was actual villagers\nthat we were staying with. And so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk\n10, 15 kilometers to see doctors, you get the doctors to the people. And we started engaging\nthe medical community, and you know, we thought\nwe were real bright sparks -- \"We've come up with this great idea: mobile health clinics, widely distributed\nthroughout sub-Saharan Africa.\" And the medical community there said, \"We've said this for the last decade. We know this. We just don't know\nhow to show this.\" So in a way, we had taken pre-existing\nneeds and shown solutions. And so again, we had a whole variety\nof ideas that came in. This one I personally love, because the idea is that architecture\nis not just about solutions, but about raising awareness. This is a kenaf clinic. You get seed and you grow it\nin a plot of land, and it grows 14 feet in a month. And on the fourth week, the doctors\ncome and they mow out an area, put a tensile structure on the top, and when the doctors\nhave finished treating and seeing patients and villagers, you cut down the clinic and you eat it. It's an eat-your-own-clinic. So it's dealing with the fact\nthat if you have AIDS, you also need to have nutrition rates, and the idea of nutrition is as important as getting antiretrovirals out there. So you know, this is a serious solution. This one I love. The idea is it's not just a clinic,\nit's a community center. This looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community, so it can be a self-sustaining project. Every one of these projects\nis sustainable. That's not because\nI'm a tree-hugging green person. It's because when you live\non four dollars a day, you're living on survival\nand you have to be sustainable. You have to know where\nyour energy is coming from, you have to know where\nyour resource is coming from, and you have to keep the maintenance down. So this is about getting\nan economic engine, and then at night,\nit turns into a movie theater. So it's not an AIDS clinic.\nIt's a community center. So you can see ideas. And these ideas developed into prototypes, and they were eventually built. And currently, as of this year, there are clinics rolling out\nin Nigeria and Kenya. From that, we also developed Siyathemba. The community came to us and said, \"The problem is that the girls\ndon't have education.\" And we're working in an area where young women\nbetween the ages of 16 and 24 have a 50 percent HIV/AIDS rate. And that's not\nbecause they're promiscuous, it's because there's no knowledge. And so we decided to look\nat the idea of sports, and create a youth sports center that doubled as an HIV/AIDS\noutreach center, and the coaches of the girls' team\nwere also trained doctors. So that there would be a very slow way\nof developing confidence in health care. And we picked nine finalists, and then those nine finalists were\ndistributed throughout the entire region, and then the community\npicked their design. They said, this is our design, because it's not only\nabout engaging a community; it's about empowering a community, and about getting them to be\na part of the rebuilding process. So, the winning design is here. And then, of course,\nwe actually go and work with the community and the clients. So this is the designer. He's out there working\nwith the first ever women's soccer team in KwaZulu-Natal, Siyathemba. And they can tell it better. (A cappella singing\nin a South African language) Video: Well, my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza. I work at the Africa Centre,\nI'm an IT user consultant. I'm also the national football player\nfor South Africa, Banyana Banyana. And I also play in the Vodacom League,\nfor the team called Tembisa, which has now changed to Siyathemba. This is our home ground. Cameron Sinclair: I'm going to show that\nlater because I'm running out of time. I can see Chris looking at me slyly. This was a connection,\njust a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop Africa's first\ntelemedicine center, in Tanzania. And we met, literally,\na couple of months ago. We've already developed a design. The team is over there,\nworking in partnership. This was a matchmaking,\nthanks to a couple of TEDsters -- Sun [Microsystems],\nCheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli, who connected me\nwith this amazing African woman. And we start construction in June,\nand it will be opened by TEDGlobal. So when you come to TEDGlobal,\nyou can check it out. But what we're known probably most for\nis dealing with disasters and development, and we've been involved\nin a lot of issues, such as the tsunami\nand also things like Hurricane Katrina. This is a 370-dollar shelter\nthat can be easily assembled. This is a community-designed\ncommunity center. And what that means is we actually\nlive and work with the community, and they're part of the design process. The kids actually get\ninvolved in mapping out where the community center should be. And then eventually, the community,\nthrough skills training, end up building the building with us. Here is another school. This is what the UN gave these guys\nfor six months -- 12 plastic tarps. This was in August. This was the replacement;\nthat's supposed to last for two years. When the rain comes down,\nyou can't hear a thing, and in the summer,\nit's about 140 degrees inside. So we said, if the rain's coming\ndown, let's get fresh water. So every one of our schools\nhas a rainwater collection system. Very low cost: three classrooms\nand rainwater collection is 5,000 dollars. This was raised by hot chocolate\nsales in Atlanta. It's built by the parents of the kids. The kids are out there on-site,\nbuilding the buildings. And it opened a couple of weeks ago, and there's 600 kids\nthat are now using the schools. (Applause) So, disaster hits home. We see the bad stories\non CNN and Fox and all that, but we don't see the good stories. Here is a community that got together,\nand they said \"no\" to waiting. They formed a partnership,\na diverse partnership of players, to actually map out East Biloxi, to figure out who's getting involved. We've had over 1,500 volunteers\nrebuilding, rehabbing homes. Figuring out what FEMA regulations are, not waiting for them to dictate\nto us how you should rebuild. Working with residents, getting them out of their homes,\nso they don't get ill. This is what they're\ncleaning up on their own. Designing housing. This house is going in\nin a couple of weeks. This is a rehabbed home,\ndone in four days. This is a utility room\nfor a woman who is on a walker. She's 70 years old.\nThis is what FEMA gave her. 600 bucks, happened two days ago. We put together, very quickly, a washroom. It's built, it's running and she just\nstarted a business today, where she's washing\nother people's clothes. These are the Calhouns. They're photographers who had documented\nthe Lower Ninth for the last 40 years. That was their home,\nand these are the photographs they took. And we're helping, working with them\nto create a new building. Projects we've done. Projects we've been a part of, support. Why don't aid agencies do this? This is the UN tent. This is the new UN tent,\njust introduced this year. Quick to assemble. It's got a flap -- that's the invention. It took 20 years to design this\nand get it implemented in the field. I was 12 years old. There's a problem here. Luckily, we're not alone. There are hundreds and hundreds\nand hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of architects\nand designers and inventors around the world that are getting\ninvolved in humanitarian work. More hemp houses -- it's a theme\nin Japan, apparently. I'm not sure what they're smoking. (Laughter) This is a Grip Clip,\ndesigned by somebody who said, \"All you need is some way\nto attach membrane structures to physical support beams.\" This guy designed for NASA,\nis now doing housing. I'm going to whip through this quickly, because I know I've got\nonly a couple of minutes. So this is all done in the last two years. I showed you something\nthat took 20 years to do. And this is just a selection of things that were built\nin the last couple of years. From Brazil to India, Mexico, Alabama, China, Israel, Palestine, Vietnam. The average age of a designer\nwho gets involved in this project is 32 -- that's how old I am. So it's a young -- I just have to stop here,\nbecause Arup is in the room, and this is the best-designed\ntoilet in the world. If you're ever, ever in India,\ngo use this toilet. (Laughter) Chris Luebkeman will tell you why. I'm sure that's how he wanted\nto spend the party. But the future is not going to be\nthe sky-scraping cities of New York, but this. And when you look at this, you see crisis. What I see is many, many inventors. One billion people live in abject poverty. We hear about them all the time. Four billion live in growing\nbut fragile economies. One in seven live\nin unplanned settlements. If we do nothing about the housing crisis\nthat's about to happen, in 20 years, one in three people\nwill live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp. Look left, look right:\none of you will be there. How do we improve the living standards\nof five billion people? With 10 million solutions. So I wish to develop a community that actively embraces\ninnovative and sustainable design to improve the living\nconditions for everyone. Chris Anderson: Wait a sec --\nthat's your wish? CS: That's my wish. CA: That's his wish! (Applause) CS: We started Architecture for Humanity\nwith 700 dollars and a website. So Chris somehow decided\nto give me 100,000. So why not this many people? Open-source architecture is the way to go. You have a diverse community\nof participants -- and we're not just talking\nabout inventors and designers, but we're talking about the funding model. My role is not as a designer; it's as a conduit between the design world\nand the humanitarian world. And what we need is something\nthat replicates me globally, because I haven't slept in seven years. (Laughter) Secondly, what will this thing be? Designers want to respond\nto issues of humanitarian crisis, but they don't want\nsome company in the West taking their idea\nand basically profiting from it. So Creative Commons has developed\nthe Developing Nations license. And what that means\nis that a designer can -- The Siyathemba project I showed was the first ever building to have\na Creative Commons license on it. As soon as that is built, anyone\nin Africa or any developing nation can take the construction documents\nand replicate it for free. (Applause) So why not allow designers\nthe opportunity to do this, but still protect their rights here? We want to have a community\nwhere you can upload ideas, and those ideas can be tested\nin an earthquake, in flood, in all sorts of austere environments. The reason that's important is I don't want to wait\nfor the next Katrina to find out if my house works. That's too late, we need to do it now. So doing that globally -- and I want this whole thing\nto work multi-lingually. When you look at the face of an architect,\nmost people think a gray-haired white guy. I don't see that;\nI see the face of the world. So I want everyone\nfrom all over the planet to be able to be a part\nof this design and development. The idea of needs-based competitions -- XPRIZE for the other 98 percent,\nif you want to call it that. We also want to look\nat ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together, and the idea of integrating\nmanufacturers -- fab labs in every country. When I hear about the $100 laptop\nand it's going to educate every child -- educate every designer in the world. Put one in every favela,\nevery slum settlement. Because you know what?\nInnovation will happen. And I need to know that.\nIt's called the leap-back. We talk about leapfrog technologies. I write with Worldchanging, and the one thing\nwe've been talking about is, I learn more on the ground\nthan I've ever learned here. So let's take those ideas,\nadapt them, and we can use them. These ideas are supposed to be adaptable; they should have\nthe potential for evolution; they should be developed\nby every nation in the world and useful for every nation in the world. What will it take? There should be a sheet. I don't have time to read this,\nbecause I'm going to be yanked off. CA: Let's just leave it up for a sec. CS: Well, what will it take?\nYou guys are smart. So it's going to take a lot\nof computing power, because I want the idea\nthat any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate\nin developing these designs, but utilize the designs. Also, a process of reviewing the designs. I want every Arup engineer\nin the world to check and make sure that we're doing stuff that's standing, because those guys\nare the best in the world. Plug. And so, you know, I want these -- I just should note: I have two laptops\nand one of them is there, and that has 3000 designs on it. If I drop that laptop ... What happens? So it's important to have\nthese proven ideas put up there, easy to use, easy to get ahold of. My mom once said, \"There's nothing worse\nthan being all mouth and no trousers.\" (Laughter) I'm fed up of talking about making change. You only make it by doing it. We've changed FEMA guidelines;\nwe've changed public policy; we've changed international response --\nbased on building things. So for me, it's important that we create\na real conduit for innovation, and that it's free innovation. Think of free culture --\nthis is free innovation. Somebody said this a couple of years back. I will give points for those who know it. But I think the man was maybe\n25 years too early. So let's do it. Thank you. (Applause)"

        "transcript": "I'm the luckiest guy in the world. I got to see the last case\nof killer smallpox in the world. I was in India this past year, and I may have seen\nthe last cases of polio in the world. There's nothing that makes\nyou feel more -- the blessing and the honor\nof working in a program like that -- than to know that something\nthat horrible no longer exists. So I'm going to tell you -- (Applause) so I'm going to show you\nsome dirty pictures. They are difficult to watch,\nbut you should look at them with optimism, because the horror\nof these pictures will be matched by the uplifting quality of knowing\nthat they no longer exist. But first, I'm going to tell you\na little bit about my own journey. My background is not exactly\nthe conventional medical education that you might expect. When I was an intern in San Francisco, I heard about a group of Native Americans\nwho had taken over Alcatraz Island, and a Native American\nwho wanted to give birth on that island, and no other doctor wanted\nto go and help her give birth. I went out to Alcatraz, and I lived\non the island for several weeks. She gave birth; I caught\nthe baby; I got off the island; I landed in San Francisco; and all the press wanted to talk to me, because my three weeks on the island\nmade me an expert in Indian affairs. (Laughter) I wound up on every television show. Someone saw me on television;\nthey called me up; and they asked me if I'd like to be in a movie\nand to play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll stars\nwho were traveling in a bus ride from San Francisco to England. And I said, yes, I would do that, so I became the doctor\nin an absolutely awful movie called \"Medicine Ball Caravan.\" (Laughter) Now, you know from the '60s, you're either on the bus\nor you're off the bus; I was on the bus. My wife of 37 years and I joined the bus. Our bus ride took us\nfrom San Francisco to London, then we switched buses at the big pond. We then got on two more buses and we drove through Turkey\nand Iran, Afghanistan, over the Khyber Pass into Pakistan,\nlike every other young doctor. This is us at the Khyber Pass,\nand that's our bus. We had some difficulty getting\nover the Khyber Pass. But we wound up in India. And then, like everyone else\nin our generation, we went to live in a Himalayan monastery. (Laughter) This is just like a residency program, for those of you\nthat are in medical school. (Laughter) And we studied with a wise man,\na guru named Karoli Baba, who then told me to get rid of the dress, put on a three-piece suit, go join the United Nations as a diplomat and work for the World\nHealth Organization. And he made an outrageous prediction\nthat smallpox would be eradicated, and that this was God's gift to humanity, because of the hard work\nof dedicated scientists. And that prediction came true. This little girl is Rahima Banu, and she was the last case\nof killer smallpox in the world. And this document is the certificate\nthat the global commission signed, certifying the world to have eradicated\nthe first disease in history. The key to eradicating smallpox\nwas early detection, early response. I'm going to ask you to repeat that:\nearly detection, early response. Can you say that? Audience: Early detection, early response. Larry Brilliant: Smallpox\nwas the worst disease in history. It killed more people\nthan all the wars in history. In the last century,\nit killed 500 million people. You're reading about Larry Page already. Somebody reads very fast. (Laughter) In the year that Larry Page\nand Sergey Brin -- with whom I have a certain affection\nand a new affiliation -- in the year in which they were born, two million people died of smallpox. We declared smallpox eradicated in 1980. This is the most important slide\nthat I've ever seen in public health, [Sovereigns killed by smallpox]\nbecause it shows you to be the richest and the strongest, and to be kings and queens of the world, did not protect you\nfrom dying of smallpox. Never can you doubt\nthat we are all in this together. But to see smallpox\nfrom the perspective of a sovereign is the wrong perspective. You should see it\nfrom the perspective of a mother, watching her child develop\nthis disease and standing by helplessly. Day one, day two, day three, day four, day five, day six. You're a mother and you're\nwatching your child, and on day six, you see\npustules that become hard. Day seven, they show the classic scars\nof smallpox umbilication. Day eight. And Al Gore said earlier that the most photographed\nimage in the world, the most printed image in the world, was that of the Earth. But this was in 1974,\nand as of that moment, this photograph was the photograph\nthat was the most widely printed, because we printed two billion copies\nof this photograph, and we took them\nhand to hand, door to door, to show people and ask them\nif there was smallpox in their house, because that was our surveillance system. We didn't have Google,\nwe didn't have web crawlers, we didn't have computers. By day nine -- you look at this picture\nand you're horrified; I look at this picture\nand I say, \"Thank God,\" because it's clear that this is only\nan ordinary case of smallpox, and I know this child will live. And by day 13, the lesions\nare scabbing, his eyelids are swollen, but you know this child has\nno other secondary infection. And by day 20, while he will be\nscarred for life, he will live. There are other kinds of smallpox\nthat are not like that. This is confluent smallpox, in which there isn't a single place\non the body where you could put a finger and not be covered by lesions. Flat smallpox, which killed 100 percent\nof people who got it. And hemorrhagic smallpox,\nthe most cruel of all, which had a predilection\nfor pregnant women. I've probably had 50 women die. They all had hemorrhagic smallpox. I've never seen anybody die from it\nwho wasn't a pregnant woman. In 1967, the WHO embarked\non what was an outrageous program to eradicate a disease. In that year, there were 34 countries\naffected with smallpox. By 1970, we were down to 18 countries. 1974, we were down to five countries. But in that year,\nsmallpox exploded throughout India. And India was the place\nwhere smallpox made its last stand. In 1974, India had\na population of 600 million. There are 21 linguistic states in India, which is like saying\n21 different countries. There are 20 million people\non the road at any time, in buses and trains, walking;\n500,000 villages, 120 million households, and none of them wanted to report if they had a case\nof smallpox in their house, because they thought that smallpox\nwas the visitation of a deity, Shitala Mata, the cooling mother, and it was wrong to bring\nstrangers into your house when the deity was in the house. No incentive to report smallpox. It wasn't just India\nthat had smallpox deities; smallpox deities were\nprevalent all over the world. So, how we eradicated smallpox was -- mass vaccination wouldn't work. You could vaccinate everybody in India, but one year later there'd be\n21 million new babies, which was then the population of Canada. It wouldn't do just to vaccinate everyone. You had to find every single\ncase of smallpox in the world at the same time, and draw\na circle of immunity around it. And that's what we did. In India alone, my 150,000 best friends\nand I went door to door, with that same picture, to every single house in India. We made over one billion house calls. And in the process,\nI learned something very important. Every time we did a house-to-house search, we had a spike in the number\nof reports of smallpox. When we didn't search, we had\nthe illusion that there was no disease. When we did search, we had the illusion\nthat there was more disease. A surveillance system was necessary, because what we needed\nwas early detection, early response. So we searched and we searched, and we found every case\nof smallpox in India. We had a reward. We raised the reward. We continued to increase the reward. We had a scorecard\nthat we wrote on every house. And as we did that, the number of reported cases\nin the world dropped to zero. And in 1980, we declared the globe\nfree of smallpox. It was the largest campaign\nin United Nations history, until the Iraq war. 150,000 people from all over the world -- doctors of every race,\nreligion, culture and nation, who fought side by side,\nbrothers and sisters, with each other, not against each other, in a common cause\nto make the world better. But smallpox was the fourth disease\nthat was intended for eradication. We failed three other times. We failed against malaria,\nyellow fever and yaws. But soon we may see polio eradicated. But the key to eradicating polio\nis early detection, early response. This may be the year we eradicate polio. That will make it\nthe second disease in history. And David Heymann, who's watching\nthis on the webcast -- David, keep on going. We're close! We're down to four countries. (Applause) I feel like Hank Aaron. Barry Bonds can replace me any time. Let's get another disease off the list\nof terrible things to worry about. I was just in India working on\nthe polio program. The polio surveillance program\nis four million people going door to door. That is the surveillance system. But we need to have\nearly detection, early response. Blindness, the same thing. The key to discovering blindness\nis doing epidemiological surveys and finding out the causes of blindness, so you can mount the correct response. The Seva Foundation\nwas started by a group of alumni of the Smallpox Eradication Programme, who, having climbed the highest mountain, tasted the elixir of the success\nof eradicating a disease, wanted to do it again. And over the last 27 years,\nSeva's programs in 15 countries have given back sight\nto more than two million blind people. Seva got started because we wanted\nto apply these lessons of surveillance and epidemiology to something which nobody else\nwas looking at as a public health issue: blindness, which heretofore had been\nthought of only as a clinical disease. In 1980, Steve Jobs gave me\nthat computer, which is Apple number 12, and it's still in Kathmandu,\nand it's still working, and we ought to go get it and auction\nit off and make more money for Seva. And we conducted the first Nepal survey\never done for health, and the first nationwide\nblindness survey ever done, and we had astonishing results. Instead of finding out\nwhat we thought was the case -- that blindness was caused mostly\nby glaucoma and trachoma -- we were astounded to find out that blindness was caused\ninstead by cataract. You can't cure or prevent\nwhat you don't know is there. In your TED packages\nthere's a DVD, \"Infinite Vision,\" about Dr. V and the Aravind Eye Hospital. I hope that you will take a look at it. Aravind, which started as a Seva project, is now the world's largest\nand best eye hospital. This year, that one hospital\nwill give back sight to more than 300,000 people\nin Tamil Nadu, India. (Applause) Bird flu. I stand here as a representative\nof all terrible things -- this might be the worst. The key to preventing\nor mitigating pandemic bird flu is early detection and rapid response. We will not have a vaccine\nor adequate supplies of an antiviral to combat bird flu if it occurs\nin the next three years. WHO stages the progress of a pandemic. We are now at stage three\non the pandemic alert stage, with just a little bit\nof human-to-human transmission, but no human-to-human-to-human\nsustained transmission. The moment WHO says\nwe've moved to category four -- this will not be like Katrina. The world as we know it will stop. There'll be no airplanes flying. Would you get in an airplane\nwith 250 people you didn't know, coughing and sneezing, when you knew that some of them\nmight carry a disease that could kill you, for which you had\nno antivirals or vaccine? I did a study of the top epidemiologists\nin the world in October. I asked them -- these are all fluologists\nand specialists in influenza -- and I asked them the questions\nyou'd like to ask them: What do you think the likelihood\nis that there'll be a pandemic? If it happens, how bad\ndo you think it will be? Fifteen percent said they thought\nthere'd be a pandemic within three years. But much worse than that, 90 percent said they thought\nthere'd be a pandemic within your children\nor your grandchildren's lifetime. And they thought\nthat if there was a pandemic, a billion people would get sick. As many as 165 million people would die. There would be a global\nrecession and depression as our just-in-time inventory system and the tight rubber band\nof globalization broke, and the cost to our economy\nof one to three trillion dollars would be far worse for everyone\nthan merely 100 million people dying, because so many more people\nwould lose their job and their healthcare benefits, that the consequences\nare almost unthinkable. And it's getting worse,\nbecause travel is getting so much better. Let me show you a simulation\nof what a pandemic looks like. So we know what we're talking about. Let's assume, for example,\nthat the first case occurs in South Asia. It initially goes quite slowly. You get two or three discrete locations. Then there'll be secondary outbreaks,\nand the disease will spread from country to country so fast\nthat you won't know what hit you. Within three weeks\nit will be everywhere in the world. Now, if we had an \"undo\" button,\nand we could go back and isolate it and grab it when it first started --\nif we could find it early, and we had early detection\nand early response, and we could put each one\nof those viruses in jail -- that's the only way to deal with\nsomething like a pandemic. And let me show you why that is. We have a joke. This is an epidemic curve,\nand everyone in medicine, I think, ultimately gets\nto know what it is. But the joke is, an epidemiologist likes to arrive\nat an epidemic right here and ride to glory on the downhill curve. (Laughter) But you don't get to do that usually. You usually arrive right about here. What we really want is to arrive\nright here, so we can stop the epidemic. But you can't always do that. But there's an organization\nthat has been able to find a way to learn when the first cases occur, and that is called GPHIN; it's the Global Public Health\nInformation Network. And that simulation that I showed you that you thought\nwas bird flu -- that was SARS. And SARS is the pandemic\nthat did not occur. And it didn't occur because GPHIN found\nthe pandemic-to-be of SARS three months before WHO actually\nannounced it, and because of that, we were able to stop the SARS pandemic. And I think we owe\na great debt of gratitude to GPHIN and to Ron St. John, who I hope is in the audience\nsome place -- over there -- who's the founder of GPHIN. (Applause) Hello, Ron! (Applause) And TED has flown Ron here\nfrom Ottawa, where GPHIN is located, because not only\ndid GPHIN find SARS early, but you may have seen last week that Iran announced\nthat they had bird flu in Iran, but GPHIN found the bird flu\nin Iran not February 14 -- but last September. We need an early-warning system to protect us against the things\nthat are humanity's worst nightmare. And so my TED wish is based on\nthe common denominator of these experiences. Smallpox -- early detection,\nearly response. Blindness, polio --\nearly detection, early response. Pandemic bird flu --\nearly detection, early response. It is a litany. It is so obvious that our only way\nof dealing with these new diseases is to find them early\nand to kill them before they spread. So, my TED wish is for you\nto help build a global system -- an early-warning system -- to protect us against\nhumanity's worst nightmares. And what I thought I would call it\nis \"Early Detection,\" But it should really be called ... \"Total Early Detection.\"\n[TED] (Laughter) What? (Applause) What? (Applause) But in all seriousness, because this idea is birthed in TED, I would like it to be\na legacy of TED, and I'd like to call it the \"International System for Total\nEarly Disease Detection.\" [INSTEDD] And INSTEDD then becomes our mantra. So instead of a hidden\npandemic of bird flu, we find it and immediately contain it. Instead of a novel virus\ncaused by bio-terror or bio-error, or shift or drift,\nwe find it and we contain it. Instead of industrial\naccidents like oil spills or the catastrophe in Bhopal, we find them, and we respond to them. Instead of famine,\nhidden until it is too late, we detect it, and we respond. And instead of a system\nwhich is owned by a government, and hidden in the bowels of government, let's build an early detection system that's freely available to anyone\nin the world in their own language. Let's make it transparent,\nnon-governmental, not owned by any single\ncountry or company, housed in a neutral country,\nwith redundant backup in a different time zone\nand a different continent. And let's build it on GPHIN. Let's start with GPHIN. Let's increase the websites\nthat they crawl from 20,000 to 20 million. Let's increase the languages they crawl from seven to 70, or more. Let's build in outbound\nconfirmation messages, using text messages or SMS\nor instant messaging to find out from people\nwho are within 100 meters of the rumor that you hear, if it is, in fact, valid. And let's add satellite confirmation. And we'll add Gapminder's\namazing graphics to the front end. And we'll grow it\nas a moral force in the world, finding out those terrible things before anybody else knows about them, and sending our response to them, so that next year,\ninstead of us meeting here, lamenting how many terrible things\nthere are in the world, we will have pulled together, used the unique skills\nand the magic of this community, and be proud that we have done\neverything we can to stop pandemics, other catastrophes, and change\nthe world, beginning right now. (Applause) Chris Anderson: An amazing presentation. First of all, just so\neveryone understands: you're saying that\nby creating web crawlers, looking on the Internet for patterns, they can detect something suspicious before WHO, before anyone else can see it? Give an example of how\nthat could possibly be true. Larry Brilliant: You're not mad\nabout the copyright violation? CA: No. I love it. (Laughter) LB: Well, as Ron St. John -- I hope you'll go and meet him\nin the dinner afterwards and talk to him. When he started GPHIN -- In 1997, there was an outbreak\nof bird flu -- H5N1. It was in Hong Kong. And a remarkable doctor in Hong Kong\nresponded immediately, by slaughtering 1.5 million\nchickens and birds, and they stopped\nthat outbreak in its tracks. Immediate detection, immediate response. Then a number of years went by, and there were a lot\nof rumors about bird flu. Ron and his team in Ottawa\nbegan to crawl the web -- only crawling 20,000 different websites,\nmostly periodicals -- and they read about\nand heard about a concern, of a lot of children who had high fever\nand symptoms of bird flu. They reported this to WHO. WHO took a little while taking action, because WHO will only receive\na report from a government, because it's the United Nations. But they were able to point\nto WHO and let them know that there was this surprising\nand unexplained cluster of illnesses that looked like bird flu. That turned out to be SARS. That's how the world found out about SARS. And because of that,\nwe were able to stop SARS. Now, what's really important is that,\nbefore there was GPHIN, 100 percent of all the world's\nreports of bad things -- whether you're talking about famine or you're talking about bird flu\nor you're talking about Ebola -- 100 percent of all those reports\ncame from nations. The moment these guys in Ottawa -- on a budget of 800,000 dollars\na year -- got cracking, 75 percent of all the reports\nin the world came from GPHIN, 25 percent of all the reports in the world came from all the other 180 nations. Now, here's what's really interesting: after they'd been working\nfor a couple years, what do you think happened\nto those nations? They felt pretty stupid. So they started sending in\ntheir reports early. And now, their reporting percentage\nis down to 50 percent, because other nations\nhave started to report. So, can you find diseases\nearly by crawling the web? Of course you can. Can you find it even earlier\nthan GPHIN does now? Of course you can. You saw that they found SARS\nusing their Chinese web crawler a full six weeks before they found it\nusing their English web crawler. Well, they're only crawling\nin seven languages. These bad viruses really\ndon't have any intention of showing up first in English\nor Spanish or French. (Laughter) So yes, I want to take GPHIN,\nI want to build on it. I want to add all the languages\nof the world that we possibly can. I want to make this open to everybody, so that the health officer\nin Nairobi or in Patna, Bihar will have as much access to it\nas the folks in Ottawa or in CDC. And I want to make it part of our culture that there is a community of people\nwho are watching out for the worst nightmares of humanity, and that it's accessible to everyone."

        "transcript": "I can't help but this wish: to think about when you're a little kid,\nand all your friends ask you, \"If a genie could give you\none wish in the world, what would it be?\" And I always answered, \"Well, I'd want the wish to have the wisdom to know\nexactly what to wish for.\" Well, then you'd be screwed, because you'd know what to wish for,\nand you'd use up your wish, and now, since we only have one wish --\nunlike last year they had three wishes -- I'm not going to wish for that. So let's get to what I would like,\nwhich is world peace. And I know what you're thinking: You're thinking, \"The poor girl up there, she thinks she's at a beauty pageant. She's not. She's at the TED Prize.\" (Laughter) But I really do think it makes sense. And I think that\nthe first step to world peace is for people to meet each other. I've met a lot of different\npeople over the years, and I've filmed some of them, from a dotcom executive in New York\nwho wanted to take over the world, to a military press officer in Qatar, who would rather not take over the world. If you've seen the film\n\"Control Room\" that was sent out, you'd understand a little bit why. (Applause) Thank you. Wow! Some of you watched it.\nThat's great. That's great. So basically what I'd like\nto talk about today is a way for people to travel, to meet people in a different way than -- because you can't travel\nall over the world at the same time. And a long time ago --\nwell, about 40 years ago -- my mom had an exchange student. And I'm going to show you\nslides of the exchange student. This is Donna. This is Donna at the Statue of Liberty. This is my mother and aunt\nteaching Donna how to ride a bike. This is Donna eating ice cream. And this is Donna teaching my aunt\nhow to do a Filipino dance. I really think as the world\nis getting smaller, it becomes more and more important that we learn each other's dance moves, that we meet each other,\nwe get to know each other, we are able to figure out\na way to cross borders, to understand each other, to understand\npeople's hopes and dreams, what makes them laugh and cry. And I know that we can't\nall do exchange programs, and I can't force everybody to travel; I've already talked about that\nto Chris and Amy, and they said that\nthere's a problem with this: You can't force people, free will. And I totally support that,\nso we're not forcing people to travel. But I'd like to talk\nabout another way to travel that doesn't require\na ship or an airplane, and just requires a movie camera,\na projector and a screen. And that's what I'm going\nto talk to you about today. I was asked that I speak a little bit\nabout where I personally come from, and Cameron, I don't know how\nyou managed to get out of that one, but I think that building bridges\nis important to me because of where I come from. I'm the daughter of an American mother and an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian father. So I'm the living product\nof two cultures coming together. No pun intended. (Laughter) And I've also been called, as an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian American\nwith a Persian name, the \"Middle East Peace Crisis.\" So maybe me starting to take\npictures was some kind of way to bring both sides\nof my family together -- a way to take the worlds with me,\na way to tell stories visually. It all kind of started that way, but I think that I really realized\nthe power of the image when I first went\nto the garbage-collecting village in Egypt, when I was about 16. My mother took me there. She's somebody who believes strongly\nin community service, and decided that this was something\nthat I needed to do. And so I went there and I met\nsome amazing women there. There was a center there, where they were teaching\npeople how to read and write, and get vaccinations\nagainst the many diseases you can get from sorting through garbage. And I began teaching there. I taught English, and I met\nsome incredible women there. I met people that live\nseven people to a room, barely can afford their evening meal, yet lived with this strength\nof spirit and sense of humor and just incredible qualities. I got drawn into this community\nand I began to take pictures there. I took pictures of weddings\nand older family members -- things that they wanted memories of. About two years after I started\ntaking these pictures, the UN Conference\non Population and Development asked me to show them at the conference. So I was 18; I was very excited. It was my first exhibit of photographs\nand they were all put up there, and after about two days,\nthey all came down except for three. People were very upset, very angry that I was showing\nthese dirty sides of Cairo, and why didn't I cut\nthe dead donkey out of the frame? And as I sat there, I got very depressed. I looked at this big empty wall\nwith three lonely photographs that were, you know,\nvery pretty photographs and I was like, \"I failed at this.\" But I was looking at this intense\nemotion and intense feeling that had come out of people\njust seeing these photographs. Here I was, this 18-year-old pipsqueak\nthat nobody listened to, and all of a sudden,\nI put these photographs on the wall, and there were arguments,\nand they had to be taken down. And I saw the power of the image,\nand it was incredible. And I think the most important reaction\nthat I saw there was actually from people that would never have gone\nto the garbage village themselves, that would never have seen\nthat the human spirit could thrive in such difficult circumstances. And I think it was at that point that I decided I wanted to use\nphotography and film to somehow bridge gaps,\nto bridge cultures, bring people together, cross borders. And so that's what really\nkind of started me off. Did a stint at MTV, made a film\ncalled \"Startup.com,\" and I've done a couple of music films. But in 2003, when the war\nin Iraq was about to start, it was a very surreal feeling for me, because before the war started, there was kind of this media war\nthat was going on. And I was watching television in New York, and there seemed to be just one\npoint of view that was coming across, and the coverage went\nfrom the US State Department to embedded troops. And what was coming across on the news was that there was going to be this\nclean war and precision bombings, and the Iraqis would be greeting\nthe Americans as liberators, and throwing flowers at their feet\nin the streets of Baghdad. And I knew that there\nwas a completely other story that was taking place in the Middle East,\nwhere my parents were. I knew that there was\na completely other story being told, and I was thinking, \"How are people\nsupposed to communicate with each other when they're getting completely\ndifferent messages, and nobody knows\nwhat the other's being told? How are people supposed to have\nany kind of common understanding or know how to move together\ninto the future? So I knew that I had to go there. I just wanted to be in the center. I had no plan. I had no funding. I didn't even have a camera at the time --\nI had somebody bring it there, because I wanted\nto get access to Al Jazeera, George Bush's favorite channel, and a place which I was very curious\nabout because it's disliked by many governments across the Arab world, and also called the mouthpiece\nof Osama Bin Laden by some people in the US government. So I was thinking, this station\nthat's hated by so many people has to be doing something right. I've got to go see what this is all about. And I also wanted to go see\nCentral Command, which was 10 minutes away. And that way, I could get access\nto how this news was being created -- on the Arab side, reaching the Arab world, and on the US and Western side,\nreaching the US. And when I went there and sat there, and met these people\nthat were in the center of it, and sat with these characters, I met some surprising,\nvery complex people. And I'd like to share with you\na little bit of that experience of when you sit with somebody and you film them, and you listen to them, and you allow them more\nthan a five-second sound bite. The amazing complexity of people emerges. Samir Khader: Business as usual. Iraq, and then Iraq, and then Iraq. But between us, if I'm offered\na job with Fox, I'll take it. To change the Arab nightmare\ninto the American dream. I still have that dream. Maybe I will never be able to do it, but I have plans for my children. When they finish high school, I will send them to America\nto study there. I will pay for their study. And they will stay there. Josh Rushing: The night they showed\nthe POWs and the dead soldiers -- Al Jazeera showed them -- it was powerful, because America\ndoesn't show those kinds of images. Most of the news in America\nwon't show really gory images and this showed American soldiers\nin uniform, strewn about a floor, a cold tile floor. And it was revolting. It was absolutely revolting. It made me sick at my stomach. And then what hit me was,\nthe night before, there had been some kind\nof bombing in Basra, and Al Jazeera had shown\nimages of the people. And they were equally, if not more,\nhorrifying -- the images were. And I remember having seen it\nin the Al Jazeera office, and thought to myself, \"Wow, that's gross. That's bad.\" And then going away, and probably\neating dinner or something. And it didn't affect me as much. So, the impact that had on me -- me realizing that I just saw\npeople on the other side, and those people in the Al Jazeera office must have felt the way\nI was feeling that night, and it upset me on a profound level that I wasn't as bothered\nas much the night before. It makes me hate war. But it doesn't make me believe\nthat we're in a world that can live without war yet. Jehane Noujaim: I was overwhelmed\nby the response of the film. We didn't know whether\nit would be able to get out there. We had no funding for it. We were incredibly lucky\nthat it got picked up. And when we showed the film in both the United States\nand the Arab world, we had such incredible reactions. It was amazing to see how people\nwere moved by this film. In the Arab world -- and it's not really by the film,\nit's by the characters -- I mean, Josh Rushing was\nthis incredibly complex person who was thinking about things. And when I showed the film\nin the Middle East, people wanted to meet Josh. He kind of redefined us\nas an American population. People started to ask me,\n\"Where is this guy now?\" Al Jazeera offered him a job. (Laughter) And Samir, on the other hand, was also quite an interesting character\nfor the Arab world to see, because it brought out the complexities\nof this love-hate relationship that the Arab world has with the West. In the United States, I was blown away\nby the motivations, the positive motivations\nof the American people when they'd see this film. You know, we're criticized abroad for believing we're the saviors\nof the world in some way, but the flip side of it is that, actually, when people do see\nwhat is happening abroad and people's reactions\nto some of our policy abroad, we feel this power, that we need to -- we feel like we have to get\nthe power to change things. And I saw this with audiences. This woman came up to me\nafter the screening and said, \"You know, I know this is crazy. I saw the bombs being loaded\non the planes, I saw the military going out to war, but you don't understand\npeople's anger towards us until you see the people in the hospitals\nand the victims of the war, and how do we get out of this bubble? How do we understand what\nthe other person is thinking?\" Now, I don't know whether\na film can change the world. But I know the power of it, I know that it starts people thinking\nabout how to change the world. Now, I'm not a philosopher, so I feel like I shouldn't\ngo into great depth on this, but let film speak for itself\nand take you to this other world. Because I believe that film has\nthe ability to take you across borders, I'd like you to just sit back\nand experience for a couple of minutes being taken into another world. And these couple clips take you inside\nof two of the most difficult conflicts that we're faced with today. [The last 48 hours of two\nPalestinian suicide bombers.] [Paradise Now] [Man: As long as there is injustice,\nsomeone must make a sacrifice!] [Woman: That's no\nsacrifice, that's revenge!] [If you kill, there's no difference\nbetween victim and occupier.] [Man: If we had airplanes, we wouldn't\nneed martyrs, that's the difference.] [Woman: The difference is that the Israeli\nmilitary is still stronger.] [Man: Then let us be equal in death.] [We still have Paradise.] [Woman: There is no Paradise!\nIt only exists in your head!] [Man: God forbid!] [May God forgive you.] [If you were not Abu Azzam's daughter ...] [Anyway, I'd rather have Paradise\nin my head than live in this hell!] [In this life, we're dead anyway.] [One only chooses bitterness\nwhen the alternative is even bitterer.] [Woman: And what about us?\nThe ones who remain?] [Will we win that way?] [Don't you see what you're\ndoing is destroying us?] [And that you give Israel\nan alibi to carry on?] [Man: So with no alibi, Israel will stop?] [Woman: Perhaps. We have\nto turn it into a moral war.] [Man: How, if Israel has no morals?] [Woman: Be careful!] [And the real people building\npeace through non-violence] [Encounter Point] Video: (Ambulance siren)\n[Tel Aviv, Israel 1996] [Tzvika: My wife Ayelet\ncalled me and said, ] [\"There was a suicide\nbombing in Tel Aviv.\"] [Ayelet: What do you know\nabout the casualties?] [Tzvika off-screen:\nWe're looking for three girls.] [We have no information.] [Ayelet: One is wounded here, but we\nhaven't heard from the other three.] [Tzvika: I said, \"OK,\nthat's Bat-Chen, that's my daughter.] [Are you sure she is dead?\"] [They said yes.] Video: (Police siren\nand shouting over megaphone) [Bethlehem, Occupied\nPalestinian Territories, 2003] [George: On that day, at around 6:30] [I was driving with my wife\nand daughters to the supermarket.] [When we got to here ...] [we saw three Israeli military jeeps\nparked on the side of the road.] [When we passed by the first jeep ...] [they opened fire on us.] [And my 12-year-old daughter Christine] [was killed in the shooting.] [Bereaved Families Forum, Jerusalem] [Tzvika: I'm the headmaster\nfor all parts.] [George: But there is a teacher\nthat is in charge?] [Tzvika: Yes, I have assistants.] [I deal with children all the time.] [One year after their daughters' deaths\nboth Tzvika and George join the forum] [George: At first, I thought\nit was a strange idea.] [But after thinking logically about it, ] [I didn't find any reason\nwhy not to meet them] [and let them know of our suffering.] [Tzvika: There were\nmany things that touched me.] [We see that there are Palestinians\nwho suffered a lot, who lost children,] [and still believe in the peace\nprocess and in reconciliation.] [If we who lost what is most precious\ncan talk to each other,] [and look forward to a better future,] [then everyone else must do so, too.] [From South Africa:\nA Revolution Through Music] [Amandla] (Music) (Video) Man: Song is something\nthat we communicated with people who otherwise would not have\nunderstood where we're coming from. You could give them\na long political speech, they would still not understand. But I tell you, when you finish that song, people will be like, \"Damn, I know\nwhere you niggas are coming from. I know where you guys are coming from. Death unto apartheid!\" Narrator: It's about\nthe liberation struggle. It's about those children\nwho took to the streets -- fighting, screaming,\n\"Free Nelson Mandela!\" It's about those unions\nwho put down their tools and demanded freedom. Yes. Yes! (Music and singing) (Singing) Freedom! (Applause) Jehane Noujaim: I think everybody's\nhad that feeling of sitting in a theater, in a dark room, with other strangers,\nwatching a very powerful film, and they felt that feeling\nof transformation. And what I'd like to talk about is how can we use that feeling to actually create\na movement through film? I've been listening to the talks\nin the conference, and Robert Wright said yesterday that if we have an appreciation\nfor another person's humanity, then they will have\nan appreciation for ours. And that's what this is about. It's about connecting people through film, getting these independent\nvoices out there. Now, Josh Rushing actually\nended up leaving the military and taking a job with Al Jazeera. (Laughter) So his feeling is that\nhe's at Al Jazeera International because he feels like\nhe can actually use media to bridge the gap between East and West. And that's an amazing thing. But I've been trying to think about ways to give power to these independent voices, to give power to the filmmakers, to give power to people who are trying\nto use film for change. And there are incredible organizations that are out there doing this already. There's Witness,\nthat you heard from earlier. There's Just Vision, that are working\nwith Palestinians and Israelis who are working together for peace,\nand documenting that process and getting interviews\nout there and using this film to take to Congress to show\nthat it's a powerful tool, to show that this is a woman who's had\nher daughter killed in an attack, and she believes that there\nare peaceful ways to solve this. There's Working Films\nand there's Current TV, which is an incredible platform\nfor people around the world to be able to put their -- (Applause) Yeah, it's amazing. I've watched it and I'm blown away by it and its potential to bring voices\nfrom around the world -- independent voices\nfrom around the world -- and create a truly democratic,\nglobal television. So what can we do to create\na platform for these organizations, to create some momentum, to get everybody in the world\ninvolved in this movement? I'd like for us to imagine for a second. Imagine a day when you have everyone\ncoming together from around the world. You have towns and villages\nand theaters -- all from around the world, getting together, and sitting in the dark, and sharing a communal\nexperience of watching a film, or a couple of films, together. Watching a film which maybe highlights\na character that is fighting to live, or just a character\nthat defies stereotypes, makes a joke, sings a song. Comedies, documentaries, shorts. This amazing power\ncan be used to change people and to bond people together;\nto cross borders, and have people feel like\nthey're having a communal experience. So if you imagine this day\nwhen all around the world, you have theaters and places\nwhere we project films. If you imagine projecting\nfrom Times Square to Tahrir Square in Cairo, the same film in Ramallah,\nthe same film in Jerusalem. You know, we've been talking\nto a friend of mine about using the side of the Great Pyramid and the Great Wall of China. It's endless what you can imagine, in terms of where you can project films and where you can have\nthis communal experience. And I believe that this one day,\nif we can create it, this one day can create momentum\nfor all of these independent voices. There isn't an organization\nwhich is connecting the independent voices of the world to get out there, and yet I'm hearing\nthroughout this conference that the biggest challenge in our future is understanding the other, and having mutual respect\nfor the other and crossing borders. And if film can do that, and if we can get all of these\ndifferent locations in the world to watch these films together -- this could be an incredible day. So we've already made a partnership, set up through somebody\nfrom the TED community, John Camen, who introduced me\nto Steven Apkon, from the Jacob Burns Film Center. And we started calling up everybody. And in the last week, there have been so many people\nthat have responded to us, from as close as Palo Alto,\nto Mongolia and to India. There are people that want to be\na part of this global day of film; to be able to provide a platform\nfor independent voices and independent films to get out there. Now, we've thought\nabout a name for this day, and I'd like to share this with you. Now, the most amazing part\nof this whole process has been sharing ideas and wishes, and so I invite you\nto give brainstorms onto how does this day echo into the future? How do we use technology to make\nthis day echo into the future, so that we can build community and have these communities working\ntogether, through the Internet? There was a time, many, many years ago, when all of the continents\nwere stuck together. And we call that landmass Pangea. So what we'd like to call this day of film\nis Pangea Cinema Day. And if you just imagine that all of these people\nin these towns would be watching, then I think that we can\nactually really make a movement towards people understanding\neach other better. I know that it's very intangible,\ntouching people's hearts and souls, but the only way that I know how to do it, the only way that I know how to reach out\nto somebody's heart and soul all across the world,\nis by showing them a film. And I know that there are independent\nfilmmakers and films out there that can really make this happen. And that's my wish. I guess I'm supposed to give you\nmy one-sentence wish, but we're way out of time. Chris Anderson:\nThat is an incredible wish. Pangea Cinema: The day\nthe world comes together. JN: It's more tangible than world peace,\nand it's certainly more immediate. But it would be the day that the world\ncomes together through film, the power of film. CA: Ladies and gentlemen, Jehane Noujaim."

        "transcript": "I'm really excited to be here today. I'll show you some stuff\nthat's just ready to come out of the lab, literally, and I'm really glad\nthat you guys are going to be among\nthe first to see it in person, because I really think this is going\nto really change the way we interact\nwith machines from this point on. Now, this is a rear-projected\ndrafting table. It's about 36 inches wide and it's equipped\nwith a multi-touch sensor. Normal touch sensors that you see, like on a kiosk\nor interactive whiteboards, can only register one point\nof contact at a time. This thing allows you to have\nmultiple points at the same time. They can use both my hands;\nI can use chording actions; I can just go right up and use\nall 10 fingers if I wanted to. You know, like that. Now, multi-touch sensing\nisn't completely new. People like Bill Buxton have been\nplaying around with it in the '80s. However, the approach I built here\nis actually high-resolution, low-cost, and probably\nmost importantly, very scalable. So, the technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing\nhere right now, other than probably\nits newfound accessibility. What's really interesting here\nis what you can do with it and the kind of interfaces\nyou can build on top of it. So let's see. So, for instance, we have\na lava lamp application here. Now, you can see, I can use both of my hands to kind\nof squeeze and put the blobs together. I can inject heat into the system here, or I can pull it apart\nwith two of my fingers. It's completely intuitive;\nthere's no instruction manual. The interface just kind of disappears. This started out as a screensaver app that one of the Ph.D. students\nin our lab, Ilya Rosenberg, made. But I think its true identity\ncomes out here. Now what's great about a multi-touch\nsensor is that, you know, I could be doing this\nwith as many fingers here, but of course multi-touch\nalso inherently means multi-user. Chris could be interacting\nwith another part of Lava, while I play around with it here. You can imagine\na new kind of sculpting tool, where I'm kind of warming something up,\nmaking it malleable, and then letting it cool down\nand solidifying in a certain state. Google should have\nsomething like this in their lobby. (Laughter) I'll show you a little more\nof a concrete example here, as this thing loads. This is a photographer's\nlight-box application. Again, I can use both of my hands\nto interact and move photos around. But what's even cooler\nis that if I have two fingers, I can actually grab a photo and then\nstretch it out like that really easily. I can pan, zoom\nand rotate it effortlessly. I can do that grossly\nwith both of my hands, or I can do it just with two fingers\non each of my hands together. If I grab the canvas, I can do\nthe same thing -- stretch it out. I can do it simultaneously,\nholding this down, and gripping on another one,\nstretching this out. Again, the interface just disappears here. There's no manual. This is exactly what you expect, especially if you haven't interacted\nwith a computer before. Now, when you have initiatives\nlike the $100 laptop, I kind of cringe at the idea of introducing a whole new\ngeneration to computing with this standard\nmouse-and-windows-pointer interface. This is something that I think\nis really the way we should be interacting\nwith machines from now on. (Applause) Now, of course, I can bring up a keyboard. (Laughter) And I can bring that around,\nput that up there. Obviously, this is a standard keyboard, but of course I can rescale it\nto make it work well for my hands. That's really important, because\nthere's no reason in this day and age that we should be conforming\nto a physical device. That leads to bad things, like RSI. We have so much technology nowadays that these interfaces\nshould start conforming to us. There's so little applied now\nto actually improving the way we interact with interfaces\nfrom this point on. This keyboard is probably actually\nthe really wrong direction to go. You can imagine, in the future,\nas we develop this kind of technology, a keyboard that kind of automatically\ndrifts as your hand moves away, and really intelligently anticipates\nwhich key you're trying to stroke. So -- again, isn't this great? (Laughter) Audience: Where's your lab? Jeff Han: I'm a research scientist\nat NYU in New York. Here's an example of another kind of app.\nI can make these little fuzz balls. It'll remember the strokes I'm making. Of course I can do it with all my hands. It's pressure-sensitive. What's neat about that is, I showed that two-finger gesture\nthat zooms in really quickly. Because you don't have\nto switch to a hand tool or the magnifying glass tool, you can just continuously make things in real multiple scales,\nall at the same time. I can create big things out here, but I can go back\nand really quickly go back to where I started,\nand make even smaller things here. This is going to be really important as we start getting to things\nlike data visualization. For instance, I think\nwe all enjoyed Hans Rosling's talk, and he really emphasized the fact\nI've been thinking about for a long time: We have all this great data, but for some reason,\nit's just sitting there. We're not accessing it. And one of the reasons why I think that is will be helped by things like graphics\nand visualization and inference tools, but I also think a big part of it is going to be having better interfaces, to be able to drill down\ninto this kind of data, while still thinking\nabout the big picture here. Let me show you another app here.\nThis is called WorldWind. It's done by NASA. We've all seen Google Earth; this is an open-source version of that. There are plug-ins to be able\nto load in different data sets that NASA's collected over the years. As you can see, I can use\nthe same two-fingered gestures to go down and go in really seamlessly. There's no interface, again. It really allows anybody\nto kind of go in -- and it just does\nwhat you'd expect, you know? Again, there's just no interface here.\nThe interface just disappears. I can switch to different data views. That's what's neat about this app here. NASA's really cool. These hyper-spectral images\nare false-colored so you can -- it's really good for determining\nvegetative use. Well, let's go back to this. The great thing\nabout mapping applications -- it's not really 2D, it's 3D. So, again, with a multi-point interface,\nyou can do a gesture like this -- so you can be able\nto tilt around like that -- (Surprised laughter) It's not just simply relegated\nto a kind of 2D panning and motion. This gesture is just putting\ntwo fingers down -- it's defining an axis of tilt --\nand I can tilt up and down that way. We just came up with that on the spot, it's probably not the right thing to do, but there's such interesting things\nyou can do with this interface. It's just so much fun\nplaying around with it, too. (Laughter) And so the last thing\nI want to show you is -- I'm sure we can all think\nof a lot of entertainment apps that you can do with this thing. I'm more interested in the creative\napplications we can do with this. Now, here's a simple application here --\nI can draw out a curve. And when I close it,\nit becomes a character. But the neat thing about it\nis I can add control points. And then what I can do is manipulate them\nwith both of my fingers at the same time. And you notice what it does. It's kind of a puppeteering thing, where I can use as many fingers\nas I have to draw and make -- Now, there's a lot of actual math\ngoing on under here for this to control this mesh\nand do the right thing. This technique of being able to manipulate\na mesh here, with multiple control points, is actually state of the art. It was released at SIGGRAPH last year. It's a great example\nof the kind of research I really love: all this compute power\nto make things do the right things, intuitive things,\nto do exactly what you expect. So, multi-touch interaction research\nis a very active field right now in HCI. I'm not the only one doing it,\na lot of other people are getting into it. This kind of technology is going to let\neven more people get into it, I'm looking forward to interacting\nwith all of you over the next few days and seeing how it can apply\nto your respective fields. Thank you. (Applause)"

        "transcript": "I've been at MIT for 44 years. I went to TED I. There's only one other person here,\nI think, who did that. All the other TEDs -- and I went to them all,\nunder Ricky's regime -- I talked about\nwhat the Media Lab was doing, which today has almost 500 people in it. And if you read the press, last week it actually said\nI quit the Media Lab. I didn't quit the Media Lab,\nI stepped down as chairman -- which was a kind of ridiculous title,\nbut someone else has taken it on -- and one of the things\nyou can do as a professor is you stay on as a professor. And I will now do for the rest of my life\nthe One Laptop Per Child, which I've sort of been doing\nfor a year and a half, anyway. So I'm going to tell you about this, use my 18 minutes\nto tell you why we're doing it, how we're doing it\nand then what we're doing. And at some point I'll even pass around what the $100 laptop might be like. I was asked by Chris\nto talk about some of the big issues, and so I figured I'd start with the three\nthat at least drove me to do this. And the first is pretty obvious. It's amazing when you meet\na head of state, and you say, \"What is your most precious\nnatural resource?\" They will not say \"children\" at first, and then when you say, \"children,\"\nthey will pretty quickly agree with you. And so that isn't very hard. (Laughter) Everybody agrees that whatever\nthe solutions are to the big problems, they include education,\nsometimes can be just education and can never be without\nsome element of education. So that's certainly part of it. And the third\nis a little bit less obvious. And that is that we all in this room\nlearned how to walk, how to talk, not by being taught how to talk,\nor taught how to walk, but by interacting with the world, by having certain results as a consequence\nof being able to ask for something, or being able to stand up and reach it. Whereas at about the age six,\nwe were told to stop learning that way, and that all learning from then on\nwould happen through teaching, whether it's people standing up,\nlike I'm doing now, or a book, or something. But it was really through teaching. And one of the things in general\nthat computers have provided to learning is that it now includes a kind of learning which is a little bit more\nlike walking and talking, in the sense that a lot of it is driven\nby the learner himself or herself. So with those as the principles -- some of you may know Seymour Papert. This is back in 1982,\nwhen we were working in Senegal. Because some people think that\nthe $100 laptop just happened a year ago, or two years ago,\nor we were struck by lightning -- this actually has gone back a long time,\nand in fact, back to the '60s. Here we're in the '80s. Steve Jobs had given us some laptops.\nWe were in Senegal. It didn't scale but it at least was bringing computers\nto developing countries and learning pretty quickly\nthat these kids, even though English wasn't their language, the Latin alphabet\nbarely was their language, but they could just swim like fish. They could play these like pianos. A little bit more recently,\nI got involved personally. And these are two anecdotes -- one was in Cambodia, in a village that has no electricity,\nno water, no television, no telephone, but has broadband Internet now. And these kids,\ntheir first English word is \"Google\" and they only know Skype. They've never heard of telephony. They just use Skype. And they go home at night -- they've got a broadband connection\nin a hut that doesn't have electricity. The parents love it,\nbecause when they open up the laptops, it's the brightest light source\nin the house. And talk about\nwhere metaphors and reality mix -- this is the actual school. In parallel with this,\nSeymour Papert got the governor of Maine to legislate one laptop per child\nin the year 2002. Now at the time, I think it's fair to say\nthat 80 percent of the teachers were -- let me say, apprehensive. Really, they were actually against it. And they really preferred\nthat the money would be used for higher salaries,\nmore schools, whatever. And now, three and a half\nyears later, guess what? They're reporting five things:\ndrop of truancy to almost zero, attending parent-teacher meetings -- which nobody did\nand now almost everybody does -- drop in discipline problems,\nincrease in student participation. Teachers are now saying\nit's kind of fun to teach. Kids are engaged -- they have laptops! -- and then the fifth,\nwhich interests me the most, is that the servers have to be turned off\nat certain times at night because the teachers\nare getting too much email from the kids asking them for help. So when you see that kind of thing -- this is not something\nthat you have to test. The days of pilot projects are over,\nwhen people say, \"We'd like to do three or four thousand\nin our country to see how it works.\" Screw you. Go to the back of the line\nand someone else will do it, and then when you figure out\nthat this works, you can join as well. And this is what we're doing. (Laughter) (Applause) So, One Laptop Per Child\nwas formed about a year and a half ago. It's a nonprofit association. It raised about 20 million dollars to do the engineering\nto just get this built, and then have it produced afterwards. Scale is truly important. And it's not important because you can\nbuy components at a lower price, OK? It's because you can go\nto a manufacturer -- and I will leave the name out -- but we wanted a small display, doesn't have to have\nperfect color uniformity. It can even have a pixel or two missing. It doesn't have to be that bright. And this particular manufacturer said, \"We're not interested in that.\nWe're interested in the living room. We're interested\nin perfect color uniformity. We're interested in big displays,\nbright displays. You're not part of our strategic plan.\" And I said, \"That's kind of too bad,\nbecause we need 100 million units a year.\" (Laughter) And they said, \"Oh, well, maybe we could\nbecome part of your strategic plan.\" And that's why scale counts. And that's why we will not launch this without five to 10 million units\nin the first run. And the idea is\nto launch with enough scale that the scale itself\nhelps bring the price down, and that's why I said\nseven to 10 million there. And we're doing it\nwithout a sales-and-marketing team. I mean, you're looking\nat the sales-and-marketing team. We will do it by going\nto seven large countries and getting them to agree and launch it, and then the others can follow. We have partners. It's not hard to guess\nGoogle would be one. The others are all playing to pending. And this has been\nin the press a great deal. It's the so-called Green Machine\nthat we introduced with Kofi Annan in November at the World Summit\nthat was held in Tunisia. Now once people start looking at this,\nthey say, \"Ah, this is a laptop project.\" Well, no, it's not a laptop project.\nIt's an education project. And the fun part --\nand I'm quite focused on it -- I tell people I used to be a light bulb,\nbut now I'm a laser -- I'm just going to get that thing built,\nand it turns out it's not so hard. Because laptop economics\nare the following: I say 50 percent here --\nit's more like 60, 60 percent of the cost of your laptop is sales, marketing,\ndistribution and profit. Now we have none of those, OK? None of those figure into our cost, because first of all, we sell it at cost,\nand the governments distribute it. It gets distributed\nto the school system like a textbook. So that piece disappears. Then you have display and everything else. Now the display on your laptop costs, in rough numbers,\n10 dollars a diagonal inch. That can drop to eight;\nit can drop to seven but it's not going to drop to two,\nor to one and a half, unless we do some pretty clever things. It's the rest -- that little brown box --\nthat is pretty fascinating, because the rest of your laptop\nis devoted to itself. It's a little bit like an obese person having to use most of their energy\nto move their obesity. (Laughter) And we have a situation today\nwhich is incredible. I've been using laptops\nsince their inception. And my laptop runs slower,\nless reliably and less pleasantly than it ever has before. And this year is worse. (Applause) People clap, sometimes\nyou even get standing ovations, and I say, \"What the hell's wrong\nwith you? Why are we all sitting there?\" And somebody -- to remain nameless --\ncalled our laptop a \"gadget\" recently. And I said, \"God, our laptop's going to go\nlike a bat out of hell. When you open it up,\nit's going to go 'bing.'\" It'll be on. It'll be just like it was in 1985, when you bought an Apple Macintosh 512. It worked really well. And we've been going steadily downhill. Now, people ask all the time what it is. That's what it is. The two pieces that are probably notable:\nit'll be a mesh network, so when the kids open up their laptops,\nthey all become a network, and then just need\none or two points of backhaul. You can serve a couple of thousand kids\nwith two megabits. So you really can bring into a village, and then the villages\ncan connect themselves, and you really can do it quite well. The dual mode display -- the idea is to have a display\nthat both works outdoors -- isn't it fun using your cell phone\noutdoors in the sunlight? Well, you can't see it. And one of the reasons you can't see it is because it's backlighting\nmost of the time, most cell phones. Now, what we're doing is, we're doing one\nthat will be both frontlit and backlit. And whether you manually switch it\nor you do it in the software is to be seen. But when it's backlit, it's color. And when it's frontlit,\nit's black and white at three times the resolution. Is it all worked out? No. That's why a lot of our people are\nmore or less living in Taiwan right now. And in about 30 days,\nwe'll know for sure whether this works. Probably the most important piece there is that the kids\nreally can do the maintenance. And this is again something\nthat people don't believe, but I really think it's quite true. That's the machine we showed in Tunis. This is more the direction\nthat we're going to go. And it's something\nthat we didn't think was possible. Now, I'm going to pass this around. This isn't a design, OK? So this is just a mechanical\nengineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with. And it's clearly just a model. The working one is at MIT. I'm going to pass it\nto this handsome gentleman. At least you can decide\nwhether it goes left or -- Chris Anderson: Before you do it,\nfor the people down in simulcast -- Nicholas Negroponte: Sorry! I forgot.\nCA: Just show it off a bit. So wherever the camera is --\nOK, good point. Thank you, Chris. The idea was that\nit would be not only a laptop, but that it could transform\ninto an electronic book. So it's sort of an electronic book. This is where when you go outside,\nit's in black and white. The games buttons are missing, but it'll also be a games machine, book machine. Set it up this way,\nand it's a television set. Etc., etc. -- is that enough\nfor simulcast? OK, sorry. I'll let Jim decide\nwhich way to send it afterwards. OK. Seven countries. (Laughter) I say \"maybe\" for Massachusetts,\nbecause they actually have to do a bid. By law you've got to bid,\nand so on and so forth. So I can't quite name them. In the other cases,\nthey don't have to do bids. They can decide -- it's the federal government in each case. It's kind of agonizing, because a lot of people say,\n\"Let's do it at the state level,\" because states are more nimble\nthan the feds, just because of size. And yet we count. We're really dealing\nwith the federal government. We're really dealing\nwith ministries of education. And if you look at governments\naround the world, ministries of education\ntend to be the most conservative, and also the ones that have huge payrolls. Everybody thinks\nthey know about education, a lot of culture is built into it as well. It's really hard.\nAnd so it's certainly the hard road. If you look at the countries,\nthey're pretty geoculturally distributed. Have they all agreed? No, not completely. Probably Thailand, Brazil and Nigeria are the three that are\nthe most active and most agreed. We're purposely\nnot signing anything with anybody until we actually have the working ones. And since I visit\neach one of those countries within at least every three months, I'm just going around the world\nevery three weeks. Here's sort of the schedule and I put at the bottom we might give some\naway free in two years at this meeting. Everybody says it's a $100 laptop -- you can't do it. Well, guess what, we're not. We're coming in probably at 135,\nto start, then drift down. And that's very important, because so many things hit the market\nat a price and then drift up. It's kind of the loss leader, and then as soon as it looks interesting, it can't be afforded,\nor it can't be scaled out. So we're targeting 50 dollars in 2010. The gray market's a big issue. And one of the ways -- just one -- but one of the ways to help\nin the case of the gray market is to make something\nthat is so utterly unique -- It's a little bit like the fact\nthat automobiles -- thousands of automobiles\nare stolen every day in the United States. Not one single\npost-office truck is stolen. (Laughter) And why? Because there's no market\nfor post-office trucks. It looks like a post-office truck. You can spray paint it.\nYou can do anything you want. I just learned recently: in South Africa,\nno white Volvos are stolen. Period. None. Zero. So we want to make it\nvery much like a white Volvo. Each government has a task force. This perhaps is less interesting, but we're trying to get the governments\nto all work together and it's not easy. The economics of this\nis to start with the federal governments and then later,\nto subsequently go to other -- whether it's child-to-child funding, so a child in this country buys one\nfor a child in the developing world, maybe of the same gender,\nmaybe of the same age. An uncle gives a niece or a nephew that\nas a birthday present. I mean, there are all sorts of things\nthat will happen, and they'll be very, very exciting. And everybody says -- I say --\nit's an education project. Are we providing the software? The answer is: The system certainly has software, but no, we're not providing\nthe education content. That is really done in the countries. But we are certainly constructionists. And we certainly believe\nin learning by doing and everything from Logo,\nwhich was started in 1968, to more modern things, like Scratch,\nif you've ever even heard of it, are very, very much part of it. And that's the rollout. Are we dreaming? Is this real? It actually is real. The only criticism, and people\nreally don't want to criticize this, because it is a humanitarian effort,\na nonprofit effort and to criticize it\nis a little bit stupid, actually. (Laughter) But the one thing\nthat people could criticize was, \"Great idea, but these guys can't do it.\" And that could either mean these guys,\nprofessors and so on couldn't do it, or that it's not possible. Well, on December 12, a company\ncalled Quanta agreed to build it, and since they make about one-third\nof all the laptops on the planet today, that question disappeared. So it's not a matter\nof whether it's going to happen. It is going to happen. And if it comes out\nat 138 dollars, so what? If it comes out six months late, so what? That's a pretty soft landing. Thank you. (Applause)"

        "transcript": "(Music) (Music ends) (Applause) (Applause ends) Hi, everyone. I'm Sirena. I'm 11 years old and from Connecticut. (Audience cheers) (Applause) Well, I'm not really sure why I'm here. (Laughter) I mean, what does this have to do\nwith technology, entertainment and design? Well, I count my iPod,\ncellphone and computer as technology, but this has nothing to do with that. So I did a little research on it. Well, this is what I found. Of course, I hope I can memorize it. (Clears throat) The violin is made of a wood box\nand four metal strings. By pulling a string, it vibrates\nand produces a sound wave, which passes through\na piece of wood called a bridge, and goes down to the wood box\nand gets amplified, but ... let me think. (Laughter) Placing your finger\nat different places on the fingerboard changes the string length, and that\nchanges the frequency of the sound wave. (Sighs) Oh, my gosh! (Laughter) OK, this is sort of technology, but I can call it\na 16th-century technology. But actually, the most\nfascinating thing that I found was that even the audio system\nor wave transmission nowadays are still based on the same principle\nof producing and projecting sound. Isn't that cool? (Laughter) (Applause) Design -- I love its design. I remember when I was little,\nmy mom asked me, \"Would you like to play\nthe violin or the piano?\" I looked at that giant monster\nand said to myself -- \"I am not going to lock myself\non that bench the whole day!\" (Laughter) This is small and lightweight. I can play from standing,\nsitting or walking. And, you know what? The best of all is that\nif I don't want to practice, (Whispering) I can hide it. (Laughter) The violin is very beautiful. Some people relate it\nas the shape of a lady. But whether you like it or not,\nit's been so for more than 400 years, unlike modern stuff\n[that] easily looks dated. But I think it's very personal\nand unique that, although each violin looks pretty similar, no two violins sound the same -- even from the same maker\nor based on the same model. Entertainment -- I love the entertainment. But actually, the instrument itself\nisn't very entertaining. I mean, when I first got my violin\nand tried to play around on it, it was actually really bad, because it didn't sound the way\nI'd heard from other kids -- it was so horrible and so scratchy. So, it wasn't entertaining at all. But besides, my brother\nfound this very funny: Yuk! Yuk! Yuk! (Laughter) A few years later, I heard a joke about the greatest violinist,\nJascha Heifetz. After Mr. Heifetz's concert, a lady came over and complimented him: \"Oh, Mr. Heifetz, your violin\nsounded so great tonight!\" And Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person, so he picked up his violin and said, \"Funny -- I don't hear anything.\" (Laughter) Now I realize that as the musician, we human beings, with our great mind,\nartistic heart and skill, can change this 16th-century technology\nand a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment. Now I know why I'm here. (Music) (Music ends) (Applause) At first, I thought I was just\ngoing to be here to perform, but unexpectedly, I learned\nand enjoyed much more. But ... although some of the talks\nwere quite up there for me. (Laughter) Like the multi-dimension stuff. I mean, honestly, I'd be happy enough if I could actually get\nmy two dimensions correct in school. (Laughter) But actually, the most\nimpressive thing to me is that -- well, actually, I would also like\nto say this for all children is to say thank you to all adults,\nfor actually caring for us a lot, and to make our future world much better. Thank you. (Applause) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause) (Applause ends) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause)",

        "transcript": "(Music) (Music ends) (Applause) Thank you! (Applause continues) Thank you very much. Like the speaker before me --\nI am a TED virgin, I guess. I'm also the first time here, and ... (Laughter) I don't know what to say! (Applause) I'm really happy\nthat Mr. Anderson invited me. I'm really grateful that I get a chance\nto play for everyone. And the song that I just played\nwas by Josef Hofmann. It's called \"Kaleidoscope.\" And Hofmann is a Polish pianist\nand composer of the late 19th century, and he's widely considered\none of the greatest pianists of all time. I have another piece\nthat I'd like to play for you. It's called \"Abegg Variations,\"\nby Robert Schumann, a German 19th-century composer. The name \"Abegg\" is actually A-B-E-G-G, and that's the main theme in the melody. (Plays the notes A, B, E, G and G) That comes from the last name\nof one of Schumann's female friends. (Laughter) But he wrote that for his wife. (Laughter) So actually, if you listen carefully, there are supposed to be\nfive variations on this Abegg theme. It's written around 1834, so even though it's old,\nI hope you'll like it. (Music) (Music ends) (Applause) Now comes the part that I hate. Well, because Mr. Anderson told me that this session is called\n\"Sync and Flow,\" I was wondering, \"What do I know\nthat these geniuses don't?\" (Laughter) So, I'll talk about musical composition, even though I don't know where to start. How do I compose? I think Yamaha does a really good job\nof teaching us how to compose. What I do first is, I make a lot\nof little musical ideas you can just improvise\nhere at the piano -- and I choose one of those\nto become my main theme, my main melody, like the Abegg that you just heard. And once I choose my main theme,\nI have to decide: Out of all the styles in music,\nwhat kind of style do I want? And this year,\nI composed a Romantic style. So for inspiration,\nI listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky and all the great Romantic composers. Next, I make the structure\nof the entire piece with my teachers. They help me plan out the whole piece. And then the hard part\nis filling it in with musical ideas, because then you have to think. (Laughter) And then, when the piece\ntakes somewhat of a solified form -- solidified, excuse me -- solidified form, you're supposed to actually\npolish the piece, polish the details, and then polish the overall\nperformance of the composition. And another thing\nthat I enjoy doing is drawing. Drawing, because I like to draw,\nyou know, Japanese anime art. I think that's a craze\namong teens right now. And once I realized it, there's a parallel between creating\nmusic and creating art, because for your motive, or your\nlittle initial idea for your drawing, it's your character -- you want\nto decide who you want to draw, or if you want to draw\nan original character. And then you want to decide:\nHow are you going to draw the character? Like, am I going to use one page?\nAm I going to draw it on the computer? Am I going to use a two-page spread\nlike a comic book? For a more grandiose effect, I guess. And then you have to do\nthe initial sketch of the character, which is like your structure of a piece, and then you add pen and pencil,\nand whatever details that you need -- that's polishing the drawing. And another thing that both of these\nhave in common is your state of mind, because I know I'm one of those teenagers\nthat are really easily distracted. So if I'm trying to do homework\nand I don't feel like it, I'll try to draw or,\nyou know, waste my time. And then what happens is,\nsometimes I absolutely can't draw or I can't compose at all, and then it's like\nthere's too much on your mind. You can't focus\non what you're supposed to do. And sometimes, if you manage to use\nyour time wisely and work on it, you'll get something out of it,\nbut it doesn't come naturally. What happens is,\nif something magical happens, if something natural happens to you, you're able to produce\nall this beautiful stuff instantly, and then that's what I consider \"flow,\" because that's when everything clicks\nand you're able to do anything. You feel like you're on top of your game\nand you can do anything you want. I'm not going to play\nmy own composition today because, although I did finish it,\nit's way too long. Instead, I'd like to try something\ncalled \"improvisation.\" I have here seven note cards, one with each note\nof the musical alphabet. And I'd like someone to come up here\nand choose five -- anyone to come up here and choose five -- and then I can make it\ninto some sort of melody, and I'll improvise it. Wow. A volunteer, yay! (Laughter) (Applause) Jennifer Lin: Nice to meet you. Goldie Hawn: Thank you. Choose five? JL: Yes, five cards. Any five cards. GH: OK, one.\nJL: OK. GH: Two.\nJL: Yes. GH: Three. GH: Oh, D and F -- too familiar. (Laughter) JL: One more.\nGH: OK. \"E\" for \"effort.\" JL: Would you mind reading them out\nin the order that you chose them? GH: OK -- C, G, B, A and E. JL: Thank you very much! GH: You're welcome. And what about these? JL: I won't use them. Thank you! (Applause) Now, she chose C, G, B, A, E. I'm going to try to put that\nin some sort of order. (Plays notes) OK, that's nice. So, I'm going to have a moment to think, and I'll try to make something out of it. (Plays the five notes) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause) The next song, or the encore\nthat I'm going to play is called \"Bumble Boogie,\" by Jack Fina. (Applause) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause)",

        "transcript": "My name is Lovegrove. I only know nine Lovegroves,\ntwo of which are my parents. They are first cousins, and you know\nwhat happens when, you know -- (Laughter) So there's a terribly weird\nfreaky side to me, which I'm fighting with all the time. So to try and get through today, I've kind of disciplined myself\nwith an 18-minute talk. I was hanging on to have a pee. I thought perhaps\nif I was hanging on long enough, that would guide me\nthrough the 18 minutes. (Laughter) OK. I am known as Captain Organic and that's a philosophical position\nas well as an aesthetic position. But today what I'd like to talk\nto you about is that love of form and how form can touch\npeople's soul and emotion. Not very long ago,\nnot many thousands of years ago, we actually lived in caves, and I don't think\nwe've lost that coding system. We respond so well to form. But I'm interested\nin creating intelligent form. I'm not interested at all in blobism or any of that superficial rubbish\nthat you see coming out as design. This artificially induced\nconsumerism -- I think it's atrocious. My world is the world\nof people like Amory Lovins, Janine Benyus, James Watson. I'm in that world,\nbut I work purely instinctively. I'm not a scientist.\nI could have been, perhaps, but I work in this world\nwhere I trust my instincts. So I am a 21st-century\ntranslator of technology into products that we use everyday\nand relate beautifully and naturally with. And we should be developing things --\nwe should be developing packaging for ideas which elevate\npeople's perceptions and respect for the things\nthat we dig out of the earth and translate into products\nfor everyday use. So, the water bottle. I'll begin with this concept\nof what I call DNA. DNA: Design, Nature, Art. These are the three things\nthat condition my world. Here is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci,\n500 years ago, before photography. It shows how observation,\ncuriosity and instinct work to create amazing art. Industrial design is the art form\nof the 21st century. People like Leonardo --\nthere have not been many -- had this amazingly instinctive curiosity. I work from a similar position. I don't want to sound\npretentious saying that, but this is my drawing made\non a digital pad a couple of years ago -- well into the 21st century,\n500 years later. It's my impression of water. Impressionism being the most valuable\nart form on the planet as we know it: 100 million dollars, easily, for a Monet. I use, now, a whole new process. A few years ago I reinvented my process to keep up with people like Greg Lynn,\nThom Mayne, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas -- all these people that I think\nare persevering and pioneering with fantastic new ideas\nof how to create form. This is all created digitally. Here you see the machining,\nthe milling of a block of acrylic. This is what I show to the client to say,\n\"That's what I want to do.\" At that point, I don't know\nif that's possible at all. It's a seductor, but I just feel\nin my bones that that's possible. So we go, we look at the tooling. We look at how that is produced. These are the invisible things\nthat you never see in your life. This is the background noise\nof industrial design. That is like an Anish Kapoor\nflowing through a Richard Serra. It is more valuable\nthan the product in my eyes. I don't have one. When I do make some money,\nI'll have one machined for myself. This is the final product. When they sent it to me,\nI thought I'd failed. It felt like nothing.\nIt has to feel like nothing. It was when I put the water in that I realized that I'd put\na skin on water itself. It's an icon of water itself, and it elevates people's perception\nof contemporary design. Each bottle is different, meaning the water level\nwill give you a different shape. It's mass individualism\nfrom a single product. It fits the hand. It fits arthritic hands.\nIt fits children's hands. It makes the product strong,\nthe tessellation. It's a millefiori of ideas. In the future, they will look like that, because we need to move away\nfrom those type of polymers and use that for medical equipment and more important things,\nperhaps, in life. Biopolymers, these new\nideas for materials, will come into play in probably a decade. It doesn't look as cool, does it? But I can live up to that.\nI don't have a problem with that. I design for that condition,\nbiopolymers. It's the future. I took this video in Cape Town last year. This is the freaky side coming out. I have this special interest\nin things like this, which blow my mind. I don't know whether to,\nyou know, drop to my knees, cry; I don't know what I think. But I just know that nature -- nature improves with ever-greater purpose that which once existed, and that strangeness\nis a consequence of innovative thinking. When I look at these things,\nthey look pretty normal to me. But these things evolved over many years,\nand what we're trying to do -- I get three weeks to design a telephone.\nHow the hell do I do that, when you get these things that take\nhundreds of millions of years to evolve? How do you condense that? It comes back to instinct. I'm not talking about designing\ntelephones that look like that and I'm not looking\nat designing architecture like that. I'm just interested\nin natural growth patterns and the beautiful forms\nthat only nature really creates. How that flows through me\nand how that comes out is what I'm trying to understand. This is a scan through the human forearm. It's then blown up\nthrough rapid prototyping to reveal its cellular structure. I have these in my office. My office is a mixture\nof the Natural History Museum and a NASA space lab. It's a weird, kind of freaky place. This is one of my specimens. This is made -- bone is made from a mixture\nof inorganic minerals and polymers. I studied cooking in school\nfor four years, and in that experience, which was called \"domestic science,\" it was a bit of a cheap trick for me\nto try and get a science qualification. (Laughter) Actually, I put marijuana\nin everything I cooked -- (Laughter) And I had access to all\nthe best girls. It was fabulous. All the guys in the rugby team\ncouldn't understand. Anyway -- this is a meringue. This is another sample I have. A meringue is made exactly the same way,\nin my estimation, as a bone. It's made from\npolysaccharides and proteins. If you pour water on that, it dissolves. Could we be manufacturing\nfrom foodstuffs in the future? Not a bad idea. I don't know. I need to talk to Janine\nand a few other people about that, but I believe instinctively that\nthat meringue can become something, a car -- I don't know. I'm also interested in growth patterns: the unbridled way that nature grows things so you're not restricted by form at all. These interrelated forms,\nthey do inspire everything I do, although I might end up\nmaking something incredibly simple. This is a detail of a chair\nthat I've designed in magnesium. It shows this interlocution of elements\nand the beauty of, kind of, engineering and biological thinking, shown pretty much as a bone structure. Any one of those elements\nyou could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object. It's the world's first chair\nmade in magnesium. It cost 1.7 million dollars to develop. It's called \"Go,\" by Bernhardt, USA. It went into Time magazine in 2001\nas the new language of the 21st century. Boy. For somebody growing up in Wales\nin a little village, that's enough. It shows how you make one holistic form,\nlike the car industry, and then you break up what you need. This is an absolutely\nbeautiful way of working. It's a godly way of working. It's organic and it's essential. It's an absolutely fat-free design, and when you look at it,\nyou see human beings. When that moves into polymers, you can change the elasticity,\nthe fluidity of the form. This is an idea for a gas-injected,\none-piece polymer chair. What nature does\nis it drills holes in things. It liberates form. It takes away anything extraneous. That's what I do. I make organic things which are essential. And they look funky, too --\nbut I don't set out to make funky things because I think\nthat's an absolute disgrace. I set out to look at natural forms. If you took the idea of fractal technology\nfurther, take a membrane, shrinking it down constantly\nlike nature does -- that could be a seat for a chair. It could be a sole for a sports shoe. It could be a car blending into seats. Wow. Let's go for it.\nThat's the kind of stuff. This is what exists in nature. Observation now allows us\nto bring that natural process into the design process every day. That's what I do. This is a show\nthat's currently on in Tokyo. It's called \"Superliquidity.\"\nIt's my sculptural investigation. It's like 21st-century Henry Moore. When you see a Henry Moore, still,\nyour hair stands up. There's some amazing spiritual connect. If he was a car designer,\nphew, we'd all be driving one. In his day, he was\nthe highest taxpayer in Britain. That is the power of organic design. It contributes immensely to our -- sense of being, our sense of relationships with things, our sensuality and,\nyou know, the sort of -- even the sort of socio-erotic side,\nwhich is very important. This is my artwork.\nThis is all my process. These actually are sold as artwork.\nThey're very big prints. But this is how I get to that object. Ironically, that object was made\nby the Killarney process, which is a brand-new process here\nfor the 21st century, and I can hear Greg Lynn\nlaughing his socks off as I say that. I'll tell you about that later. When I look into these data images, I see new things. It's self-inspired. Diatomic structures, radiolaria, the things that we couldn't see\nbut we can do now -- these, again, are cored out. They're made virtually from nothing.\nThey're made from silica. Why not structures from cars like that? Coral, all these natural forces, take away what they don't need\nand they deliver maximum beauty. We need to be in that realm. I want to do stuff like that. This is a new chair which should\ncome on the market in September. It's for a company called Moroso in Italy.\nIt's a gas-injected polymer chair. Those holes you see there\nare very filtered-down, watered-down versions of the extremity\nof the diatomic structures. It goes with the flow\nof the polymer and you'll see -- there's an image coming up\nright now that shows the full thing. It's great to have companies in Italy\nwho support this way of dreaming. If you see the shadows\nthat come through that, they're actually probably\nmore important than the product, but it's the minimum it takes. The coring out of the back\nlets you breathe. It takes away any material you don't need and it actually garners flexure too. I was going to break into a dance then. This is some current work I'm doing. I'm looking at single-surface structures and how they stretch and flow. It's based on furniture typologies,\nbut that's not the end motivation. It's made from aluminum ... as opposed to aluminium, and it's grown. It's grown in my mind, and then it's grown in terms\nof the whole process that I go through. This is two weeks ago in CCP in Coventry,\nwho build parts for Bentleys and so on. It's being built as we speak and it will be on show in Phillips\nnext year in New York. I have a big show\nwith Phillips Auctioneers. When I see these animations,\noh Jesus, I'm blown away. This is what goes on\nin my studio everyday. I walk -- I'm traveling. I come back. Some guy's got that on a computer --\nthere's this like, oh my goodness. So I try to create this energy\nof invention every day in my studio. This kind of effervescent -- fully charged sense of soup\nthat delivers ideas. Single-surface products. Furniture's a good one. How you grow legs out of a surface. I would love to build this one day and perhaps I'd like\nto build it also out of flour, sugar, polymer, wood chips --\nI don't know, human hair. I don't know. I'd love a go at that.\nI don't know. If I just got some time. That's the weird side coming out again.\nA lot of companies don't understand that. Three weeks ago I was with Sony in Tokyo. They said, \"Give us the dream.\nWhat is our dream? How do we beat Apple?\" I said, \"You don't copy Apple,\nthat's for sure. You get into biopolymers.\" They looked straight through me. What a waste. Anyway. (Laughter) No, it's true. Fuck them.\nYou know, I mean -- (Laughter) I'm delivering; they're not taking. I've had this image 20 years. I've had this image of a water droplet\nfor 20 years, sitting on a hot bed. That is an image of a car for me. That's the car of the future.\nIt's a water droplet. I've been banging on about this\nlike I can't believe. Cars are all wrong. I'm going to show you\nsomething a bit weird now. They laughed everywhere\nover the world I showed this. The only place\nthat didn't laugh was Moscow. Cars are made from 30,000 components. How ridiculous is that?\nCouldn't you make that from 300? It's got a vacuum-formed,\ncarbon-nylon pan. Everything's holistically integrated.\nIt opens and closes like a bread bin. There is no engine.\nThere's a solar panel on the back and there are batteries in the wheels;\nthey're fitted like Formula 1. You take them off your wall,\nyou plug them in. Off you go. A three-wheeled car: slow, feminine, transparent, so you can see\nthe people in there. You drive different. You see that thing. You do. You do. And not anesthetized, separated from life. There's a hole at the front\nand there's a reason for that. It's a city car.\nYou drive along. You get out. You drive on to a proboscis. You get out. It lifts you up. It presents the solar panel to the sun,\nand at night, it's a street lamp. (Applause) That's what happens if you get inspired\nby the street lamp first, and do the car second. I can see these bubbles\nwith these hydrogen packages, floating around\non the ground, driven by AI. When I showed this in South Africa, everybody afterwards was going,\n\"Hey, car on a stick. Like this.\" Can you imagine? A car on a stick. (Laughter) If you put it next to\ncontemporary architecture, it feels totally natural to me. And that's what I do with my furniture. I'm not putting Charles Eames'\nfurniture in buildings anymore. I'm trying to build furniture\nwhich fits architecture. I'm trying to build\ntransportation systems. I work on aircraft for Airbus, I do all this sort of stuff trying to force these natural,\ninspired-by-nature dreams home. I'm going to finish on two things. This is the stereolithography\nof a staircase. It's a little bit of a dedication\nto James, James Watson. I built this thing for my studio. It cost me 250,000 dollars to build this. Most people go and buy the Aston Martin. I built this. This is the data that goes with that.\nIncredibly complex. Took about two years,\nbecause I'm looking for fat-free design. Lean, efficient things. Healthy products. This is built by composites. It's a single element which rotates around\nto create a holistic element, and this is a carbon-fiber handrail\nwhich is only supported in two places. Modern materials\nallow us to do modern things. This is a shot in the studio. This is how it looks\npretty much every day. You wouldn't want to have\na fear of heights coming down it. There is virtually no handrail.\nIt doesn't pass any standards. (Laughter) Who cares? (Laughter) And it has an internal handrail\nwhich gives it its strength. It's this holistic integration.\nThat's my studio. It's subterranean. It's in Notting Hill,\nnext to all the crap -- the prostitutes and all that stuff. It's next to David Hockney's\noriginal studio. It has a lighting system\nthat changes throughout the day. My guys go out for lunch.\nThe door's open. They come back in, because it's normally raining\nand they prefer to stay in. This is my studio. Elephant skull\nfrom Oxford University, 1988. I bought that last year.\nThey're very difficult to find. If anybody's got a whale skeleton\nthey want to sell me, I'll put it in the studio. So I'm just going\nto interject a little bit with some of the things\nthat you'll see in the video. It's a homemade video, made it myself\nat three o'clock in the morning just to show you how my real world is. You never see that. You never see architects or designers\nshowing you their real world. This is called a \"Plasnet.\" It's a new bio-polycarbonate chair\nI'm doing in Italy. World's first bamboo bike\nwith folding handlebars. We should all be riding one of these. As China buys all these crappy cars,\nwe should be riding things like this. Counterbalance. Like I say, it's a cross between Natural History Museum\nand a NASA laboratory. It's full of prototypes and objects. It's self-inspirational, again. I mean, the rare times when I'm there, I do enjoy it. And I get lots and lots of kids coming. I'm a contaminator for all those children\nof investment bankers -- wankers. Sorry. (Laughter) That's a solar seed.\nIt's a concept for new architecture. That thing on the top is the world's\nfirst solar-powered garden lamp -- the first produced. Giles Revell should be\ntalking here today -- amazing photography\nof things you can't see. The first sculptural model\nI made for that thing in Tokyo. Lots of stuff.\nThere's a little leaf chair -- that golden looking thing\nis called \"Leaf.\" It's made from Kevlar. On the wall is my book\ncalled \"Supernatural,\" which allows me to remember\nwhat I've done, because I forget. There's an aerated brick\nI did in Limoges last year, in Concepts for New Ceramics\nin Architecture. Gernot Oberfell, working\nat three o'clock in the morning -- and I don't pay overtime. Overtime is the passion of design, so join the club or don't. (Laughter) No, it's true. People like Tom and Greg -- we're traveling like you can't --\nwe fit it all in. I don't know how we do it. Next week I'm at Electrolux in Sweden,\nthen I'm in Beijing on Friday. You work that one out. And when I see Ed's photographs,\nI think, why the hell am I going to China? It's true. It's true. Because there's a soul\nin this whole thing. We need to have a new instinct\nfor the 21st century. We need to combine all this stuff. If all the people who were\ntalking over this period worked on a car together, it would be a joy, absolute joy. So there's a new X-light system\nI'm doing in Japan. There's Tuareg shoes from North Africa.\nThere's a Kifwebe mask. These are my sculptures. A copper jelly mold. (Laughter) It sounds like some quiz show\nor something, doesn't it? So, it's going to end. Thank you, James,\nfor your great inspiration. Thank you very much. (Applause)"

        "transcript": "In terms of invention, I'd like to tell you the tale\nof one of my favorite projects. I think it's one of the most exciting\nthat I'm working on, but I think it's also the simplest. It's a project that has the potential\nto make a huge impact around the world. It addresses one of the biggest\nhealth issues on the planet, the number one cause of death\nin children under five. Which is ...? Water-borne diseases?\nDiarrhea? Malnutrition? No. It's breathing the smoke\nfrom indoor cooking fires -- acute respiratory infections\ncaused by this. Can you believe that? I find this shocking\nand somewhat appalling. Can't we make\ncleaner burning cooking fuels? Can't we make better stoves? How is it that this can lead\nto over two million deaths every year? I know Bill Joy was talking to you\nabout the wonders of carbon nanotubes, so I'm going to talk to you\nabout the wonders of carbon macro-tubes, which is charcoal. (Laughter) So this is a picture of rural Haiti. Haiti is now 98 percent deforested. You'll see scenes like this\nall over the island. It leads to all sorts\nof environmental problems and problems that affect people\nthroughout the nation. A couple years ago\nthere was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths -- that's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills\nto stabilize the soil. So the rains come -- they go down the rivers\nand the flooding happens. Now one of the reasons\nwhy there are so few trees is this: people need to cook, and they harvest wood\nand they make charcoal in order to do it. It's not that people are ignorant\nto the environmental damage. They know perfectly well,\nbut they have no other choice. Fossil fuels are not available, and solar energy doesn't cook the way\nthat they like their food prepared. And so this is what they do. You'll find families like this who go out\ninto the forest to find a tree, cut it down and make charcoal out of it. So not surprisingly, there's a lot of effort that's been done\nto look at alternative cooking fuels. About four years ago, I took\na team of students down to Haiti and we worked with\nPeace Corps volunteers there. This is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built\nin the village where he worked. And the idea was\nthat you could take waste paper; you could compress it and make briquettes\nthat could be used for fuel. But this device was very slow. So our engineering students\nwent to work on it and with some very simple changes, they were able to triple\nthe throughput of this device. So you could imagine\nthey were very excited about it. And they took the briquettes back to MIT\nso that they could test them. And one of the things\nthat they found was they didn't burn. So it was a little\ndiscouraging to the students. (Laughter) And in fact, if you look closely, right here you can see\nit says, \"US Peace Corps.\" As it turns out, there actually wasn't\nany waste paper in this village. And while it was a good use\nof government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it\nback with him to his village, it was 800 kilometers away. And so we thought perhaps\nthere might be a better way to come up with\nan alternative cooking fuel. What we wanted to do\nis we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was\nreadily available on the local level. You see these all over Haiti as well. They're small-scale sugar mills. And the waste product from them after you extract the juice\nfrom the sugarcane is called \"bagasse.\" It has no other use. It has no nutritional value,\nso they don't feed it to the animals. It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill\nuntil eventually they burn it. What we wanted to do was\nwe wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource\nand turn it into a fuel that would be something\nthat people could easily cook with, something like charcoal. So over the next couple of years, students and I worked\nto develop a process. So you start with the bagasse,\nand then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of\na waste fifty five-gallon oil drum. After some time, after setting it on fire, you seal it to restrict the oxygen\nthat goes into the kiln, and then you end up\nwith this carbonized material here. However, you can't burn this. It's too fine and it burns too quickly\nto be useful for cooking. So we had to try to find a way\nto form it into useful briquettes. And conveniently,\none of my students was from Ghana, and he remembered a dish his mom\nused to make for him called \"kokonte,\" which is a very sticky porridge\nmade out of the cassava root. And so what we did was we looked, and we found that cassava\nis indeed grown in Haiti, under the name of \"manioc.\" In fact, it's grown all over the world -- yucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava,\nit's all the same thing -- a very starchy root vegetable. And you can make a very thick,\nsticky porridge out of it, which you can use to bind together\nthe charcoal briquettes. So we did this. We went down to Haiti. These are the graduates\nof the first Ecole de Charbon, or Charcoal Institute. And these -- (Laughter) That's right. So I'm actually\nan instructor at MIT as well as CIT. And these are the briquettes that we made. Now I'm going to take you\nto a different continent. This is India and this is the most commonly used\ncooking fuel in India. It's cow dung. And more than in Haiti,\nthis produces really smoky fires, and this is where you see\nthe health impacts of cooking with cow dung\nand biomass as a fuel. Kids and women\nare especially affected by it, because they're the ones\nwho are around the cooking fires. So we wanted to see if we could introduce\nthis charcoal-making technology there. Well, unfortunately,\nthey didn't have sugarcane and they didn't have cassava, but that didn't stop us. What we did was we found what were\nthe locally available sources of biomass. And there was wheat straw\nand there was rice straw in this area. And what we could use as a binder\nwas actually small amounts of cow manure, which they used ordinarily for their fuel. And we did side-by-side tests, and here you can see\nthe charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung. And you can see that it's a lot cleaner\nburning of a cooking fuel. And in fact, it heats the water\na lot more quickly. And so we were very happy, thus far. But one of the things that we found was when we did side-by-side\ncomparisons with wood charcoal, it didn't burn as long. And the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart\nas they were cooking. So we wanted to try to find a way\nto make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with\nwood charcoal in the markets in Haiti. So we went back to MIT, we took out the Instron machine and we figured out\nwhat sort of forces you needed in order to compress\na briquette to the level that you actually are getting\nimproved performance out of it? And at the same time that we had\nstudents in the lab looking at this, we also had community partners in Haiti\nworking to develop the process, to improve it and make it more accessible\nto people in the villages there. And after some time, we developed a low-cost press\nthat allows you to produce charcoal, which actually now burns not only -- actually, it burns longer,\ncleaner than wood charcoal. So now we're in a situation\nwhere we have a product, which is actually better than what\nyou can buy in Haiti in the marketplace, which is a very wonderful place to be. In Haiti alone, about 30 million trees\nare cut down every year. There's a possibility\nof this being implemented and saving a good portion of those. In addition, the revenue generated\nfrom that charcoal is 260 million dollars. That's an awful lot\nfor a country like Haiti -- with a population of eight million and an average income\nof less than 400 dollars. So this is where we're also moving ahead\nwith our charcoal project. And one of the things\nthat I think is also interesting, is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley\nwho's been doing risk analysis. And he's looked at the problem\nof the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal. And he's found that worldwide,\nyou could prevent a million deaths switching from wood\nto charcoal as a cooking fuel. That's remarkable, but up until now, there weren't ways\nto do it without cutting down trees. But now we have a way that's using an agricultural\nwaste material to create a cooking fuel. One of the really exciting things, though, is something that came out of the trip\nthat I took to Ghana just last month. And I think it's the coolest thing, and it's even lower tech\nthan what you just saw, if you can imagine such a thing. Here it is. So what is this? This is corncobs turned into charcoal. And the beauty of this is\nthat you don't need to form briquettes -- it comes ready made. This is my $100 laptop, right here. And actually, like Nick,\nI brought samples. (Laughter) So we can pass these around. They're fully functional,\nfield-tested, ready to roll out. (Laughter) And I think one of the things which is also remarkable\nabout this technology, is that the technology\ntransfer is so easy. Compared to the sugarcane charcoal, where we have to teach people\nhow to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step\nof cooking the binder, this comes pre-briquetted. And this is about the most exciting\nthing in my life right now, which is perhaps\na sad commentary on my life. (Laughter) But once you see it,\nlike you guys in the front row -- All right, yeah, OK. So anyway -- (Laughter) Here it is. And this is, I think, a perfect example of what Robert Wright was talking about\nin those non-zero-sum things. So not only do you have health benefits, you have environmental benefits. But this is one\nof the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits. People can make their own cooking fuel\nfrom waste products. They can generate income from this. They can save the money\nthat they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess\nand sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own. It's really rare\nthat you don't have trade-offs between health and economics,\nor environment and economics. So this is a project\nthat I just find extremely exciting and I'm really looking forward\nto see where it takes us. So when we talk about, now,\nthe future we will create, one of the things\nthat I think is necessary is to have a very clear vision\nof the world that we live in. And now, I don't actually mean\nthe world that we live in. I mean the world where women\nspend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat. I mean the world\nwhere advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles\nthat are made by hand, and where, when you work 10 hours a day, you're still only earning\n60 dollars in a month. I mean the world where women and children spend\n40 billion hours a year fetching water. That's as if the entire workforce\nof the state of California worked full time for a year\ndoing nothing but fetching water. It's a place where,\nfor example, if this were India, in this room, only three of us\nwould have a car. If this were Afghanistan, only one person in this room\nwould know how the use the Internet. If this were Zambia -- 300 of you would be farmers, 100 of you would have AIDS or HIV. And more than half of you would be living\non less than a dollar a day. These are the issues that we\nneed to come up with solutions for. These are the issues that\nwe need to be training our engineers, our designers, our business people,\nour entrepreneurs to be facing. These are the solutions\nthat we need to find. I have a few areas that I believe\nare especially important that we address. One of them is creating technologies to promote micro-finance\nand micro-enterprise, so that people who are living\nbelow the poverty line can find a way to move out -- and that they're not doing it using the same traditional\nbasket making, poultry rearing, etc. But there are new technologies\nand new products that they can make on a small scale. The next thing I believe is that we need to create\ntechnologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops. And we need to rethink\nour development strategies, so that we're not promoting\neducational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers, but rather to stop being poor farmers. And we need to think\nabout how we can do that effectively. We need to work with the people\nin these communities and give them the resources\nand the tools that they need to solve their own problems. That's the best way to do it. We shouldn't be doing it from outside. So we need to create this future,\nand we need to start doing it now. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you, incredible. Stay here. Tell us -- just while we see\nif someone has a question -- just tell us about one of the other things\nthat you've worked on. Amy Smith: Some of the other\nthings we're working on are ways to do low-cost\nwater quality testing, so that communities can maintain\ntheir own water systems, know when they're working,\nknow when they treat them, etc. We're also looking at low-cost\nwater-treatment systems. One of the really exciting things\nis looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability\nto be able to do that. CA: What's the bottleneck\npreventing this stuff getting from scale? Do you need to find entrepreneurs,\nor venture capitalists, or what do you need to take\nwhat you've got and get it to scale? AS: I think it's large numbers\nof people moving it forward. It's a difficult thing -- it's a marketplace\nwhich is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income. So you can't use the same models\nthat you use in the United States for making things move forward. And we're a pretty small staff, which is me. (Laughter) So, you know,\nI do what I can with the students. We have 30 students a year\ngo out into the field and try to implement this\nand move it forward. The other thing is you have to do things\nwith a long time frame, as, you know, you can't expect to get\nsomething done in a year or two years; you have to be looking\nfive or 10 years ahead. But I think with the vision to do that,\nwe can move forward."

        "transcript": "Charles Van Doren, who was later\na senior editor of Britannica, said the ideal encyclopedia\nshould be radical -- it should stop being safe. But if you know anything about the history\nof Britannica since 1962, it was anything but radical: still a very completely safe,\nstodgy type of encyclopedia. Wikipedia, on the other hand,\nbegins with a very radical idea, and that's for all of us\nto imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access\nto the sum of all human knowledge. And that's what we're doing. So Wikipedia -- you just saw the little\ndemonstration of it -- it's a freely licensed encyclopedia. It's written by thousands of volunteers all over the world\nin many, many languages. It's written using wiki software -- which is the type of software\nhe just demonstrated -- so anyone can quickly edit and save, and it goes live\non the Internet immediately. And everything about Wikipedia is managed\nby virtually an all-volunteer staff. So when Yochai is talking\nabout new methods of organization, he's exactly describing Wikipedia. And what I'm going to do today is tell you a little bit more\nabout how it really works on the inside. So Wikipedia's owned\nby the Wikimedia Foundation, which I founded, a nonprofit organization. And our goal, the core aim\nof the Wikimedia Foundation, is to get a free encyclopedia\nto every single person on the planet. And so, if you think\nabout what that means, it means a lot more\nthan just building a cool website. We're really interested\nin all the issues of the digital divide, poverty worldwide, empowering people everywhere\nto have the information that they need to make good decisions. And so we're going\nto have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the Internet. And so that's a big part of why\nwe've chosen the free licensing model, because that empowers local\nentrepreneurs or anyone who wants to -- they can take our content\nand do anything they like with it -- you can copy it, redistribute it -- and you can do it\ncommercially or non-commercially. So there's a lot of opportunities\nthat are going to arise around Wikipedia all over the world. We're funded by donations from the public, and one of the more\ninteresting things about that is how little money\nit actually takes to run Wikipedia. So Yochai showed you the graph\nof what the cost of a printing press was. And I'm going to tell you\nwhat the cost of Wikipedia is. But first, I'll show you how big it is. So we've got over 600,000\narticles in English. We've got two million total articles\nacross many, many different languages. The biggest languages\nare German, Japanese, French -- all the Western-European\nlanguages are quite big. But only around one-third\nof all of our traffic to our web clusters to the English Wikipedia, which is surprising to a lot of people. A lot of people think in a very\nEnglish-centric way on the Internet, but for us, we're truly global. We're in many, many languages. How popular we've gotten to be --\nwe're a top-50 website and we're more popular\nthan the New York Times. So this is where we get\nto Yochai's discussion. This shows the growth of Wikipedia --\nwe're the blue line there -- and this is the New York Times over there. And what's interesting about this is the New York Times website is a huge,\nenormous corporate operation with I have no idea\nhow many hundreds of employees. We have exactly one employee, and that employee\nis our lead software developer. And he's only been our employee\nsince January 2005, all the other growth before that ... So the servers are managed\nby a ragtag band of volunteers. All the editing is done by volunteers. And the way that we're organized is not like any traditional\norganization you can imagine. People are always asking,\n\"Well, who's in charge of this?\" or \"Who does that?\" And the answer is:\nanybody who wants to pitch in. It's a very unusual and chaotic thing. We've got over 90 servers now\nin three locations. These are managed by volunteer\nsystem administrators who are online. I can go online\nany time of the day or night and see eight to 10 people waiting for me to ask a question or something,\nanything about the servers. You could never afford\nto do this in a company. You could never afford to have a standby crew of people\n24 hours a day and do what we're doing at Wikipedia. So we're doing around\n1.4 billion page views monthly, so it's really gotten to be a huge thing. And everything is managed\nby the volunteers. And the total monthly cost\nfor our bandwidth is about 5,000 dollars. And that's essentially our main cost. We could actually do without the employee. We hired Brian because he was\nworking part-time for two years and full-time at Wikipedia, so we actually hired him, so he could get a life\nand go to the movies sometimes. So the big question when you've got\nthis really chaotic organization is, why isn't it all rubbish? Why is the website as good as it is? First of all, how good is it? Well, it's pretty good. It isn't perfect, but it's much better\nthan you would expect, given our completely chaotic model. So when you saw him make\na ridiculous edit to the page about me, you think, \"Oh, this is obviously\njust going to degenerate into rubbish.\" But when we've seen quality tests -- and there haven't been enough of these yet and I'm really encouraging\npeople to do more, comparing Wikipedia\nto traditional things -- we win hands down. So a German magazine\ncompared German Wikipedia, which is much, much smaller than English, to Microsoft Encarta\nand to Brockhaus multimedial, and we won across the board. They hired experts to come and look\nat articles and compare the quality, and we were very pleased with that result. So a lot of people have heard about\nthe Wikipedia Bush-Kerry controversy. The media has covered this\nsomewhat extensively. It started out\nwith an article in Red Herring. The reporters called me up and they -- I mean, I have to say\nthey spelled my name right, but they really wanted to say\nthe Bush-Kerry election is so contentious, it's tearing apart\nthe Wikipedia community. And so they quote me as saying, \"They're the most contentious\nin the history of Wikipedia.\" What I actually said\nis they're not contentious at all. So it's a slight misquote. (Laughter) The articles were edited quite heavily. And it is true that we did\nhave to lock the articles on a couple of occasions. Time magazine recently reported that \"Extreme action sometimes has to be taken, and Wales locked the entries\non Kerry and Bush for most of 2004.\" This came after I told the reporter\nthat we had to lock it for -- occasionally a little bit here and there. So the truth in general\nis that the kinds of controversies that you would probably think\nwe have within the Wikipedia community are not really controversies at all. Articles on controversial topics\nare edited a lot, but they don't cause much controversy\nwithin the community. And the reason for this is that most\npeople understand the need for neutrality. The real struggle is not\nbetween the right and the left -- that's where most people assume -- but it's between\nthe party of the thoughtful and the party of the jerks. And no side of the political spectrum has a monopoly\non either of those qualities. The actual truth\nabout the specific Bush-Kerry incident is that the Bush-Kerry articles were locked less than one percent\nof the time in 2004, and it wasn't because\nthey were contentious; it was just because\nthere was routine vandalism -- which happens sometimes even on stage ... (Laughter) Sometimes even reporters have reported\nto me that they vandalized Wikipedia and were amazed\nthat it was fixed so quickly. And I said -- you know, I always say,\nplease don't do that. That's not a good thing. So how do we do this? How do we manage the quality control? How does it work? So there's a few elements, mostly social policies\nand some elements of the software. So the biggest\nand the most important thing is our neutral point of view policy. This is something\nthat I set down, from the very beginning, as a core principle of the community\nthat's completely not debatable. It's a social concept of cooperation, so we don't talk a lot\nabout truth and objectivity. The reason for this is if we say we're only going to write\nthe \"truth\" about some topic, that doesn't do us a damn bit of good\nof figuring out what to write, because I don't agree with you\nabout what's the truth. But we have this\njargon term of neutrality, which has its own long history\nwithin the community, which basically says,\nany time there's a controversial issue, Wikipedia itself should not\ntake a stand on the issue. We should merely report on what\nreputable parties have said about it. So this neutrality policy\nis really important for us because it empowers a community\nthat is very diverse to come together\nand actually get some work done. So we have very diverse contributors in terms of political,\nreligious, cultural backgrounds. By having this firm neutrality policy, which is non-negotiable\nfrom the beginning, we ensure that people can work together and that the entries\ndon't become simply a war back and forth\nbetween the left and the right. If you engage in that type of behavior,\nyou'll be asked to leave the community. So, real-time peer review. Every single change on the site\ngoes to the \"Recent changes\" page. So as soon as he made his change,\nit went to the \"Recent changes\" page. That recent changes page\nwas also fed into an IRC channel, which is an Internet chat channel that people are monitoring\nwith various software tools. And people can get RSS feeds -- they can get email\nnotifications of changes. And then users can set up\ntheir own personal watch list. So my page is on quite a few\nvolunteers' watch lists, because it is sometimes vandalized. And therefore, what happens is someone\nwill notice the change very quickly, and then they'll just\nsimply revert the change. There's a \"new pages feed,\" for example, so you can go\nto a certain page of Wikipedia and see every new page as it's created. This is really important because a lot of new pages\nare just garbage that has to be deleted, you know, \"ASDFASDF.\" But also, that's some\nof the most interesting and fun things, some of the new articles. People will start an article\non some interesting topic, other people will find that intriguing and jump in and help\nand make it much better. So we do have edits by anonymous users, which is one of the most controversial\nand intriguing things about Wikipedia. So, Chris was able to do his change --\nhe didn't have to log in or anything; he just went on the website\nand made a change. But it turns out\nthat only about 18 percent of all the edits to the website are done by anonymous users. And that's a really important\nthing to understand: the vast majority of the edits\nthat go on on the website are from a very close-knit community\nof maybe 600 to 1,000 people who are in constant communication. And we have over 40 IRC channels,\n40 mailing lists. All these people know each other. They communicate.\nWe have off-line meetings. These are the people\nwho are doing the bulk of the site, and they are, in a sense,\nsemi-professionals at what they're doing. The standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher\nthan professional standards of quality. We don't always meet those standards,\nbut that's what we're striving for. And so that tight community\nis who really cares for the site, and these are some\nof the smartest people I've ever met. It's my job to say that,\nbut it's actually true. The type of people who were drawn\nto writing an encyclopedia for fun tend to be pretty smart people. The tools and the software:\nthere's lots of tools that allow us -- allow us, meaning the community -- to self-monitor\nand to monitor all the work. This is an example\nof a page history on \"flat Earth,\" and you can see some changes\nthat were made. What's nice about this page\nis you can immediately take a look at this and see, \"OK, I understand now.\" When somebody goes and looks at -- they see that someone,\nan anonymous IP number, made an edit to my page. That sounds suspicious.\nWho is this person? Somebody looks at it -- they can immediately see\nhighlighted in red all of the changes that took place -- to see, OK, well, these words\nhave changed, things like this. So that's one tool that we can use to very quickly monitor\nthe history of a page. Another thing that we do\nwithin the community is we leave everything very open-ended. Most of the social rules\nand the methods of work are left completely open-ended\nin the software. All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages. And so there's nothing\nin the software that enforces the rules. The example I've got up here\nis the Votes for Deletion page. So, I mentioned earlier,\npeople type \"ASDFASDF\" -- it needs to be deleted. Cases like that,\nthe administrators just delete it. There's no reason\nto have a big argument about it. But you can imagine there's a lot\nof other areas where the question is, is this notable enough\nto go in an encyclopedia? Is the information verifiable?\nIs it a hoax? Is it true? Is it what? So we needed a social method\nfor figuring out the answer to this. And so the method that arose\norganically within the community is the Votes For Deletion page. And in the particular\nexample we have here, it's a film, \"Twisted Issues,\" and the first person says, \"Now this is supposedly a film.\nIt fails the Google test miserably.\" The Google test is you look in Google\nand see if it's there, because if something's not even in Google,\nit probably doesn't exist at all. It's not a perfect rule, but it's a nice starting point\nfor quick research. So somebody says, \"Delete it, please.\nDelete it -- it's not notable.\" And then somebody says,\n\"Wait, I found it. I found it in a book, 'Film Threat Video Guide:\nthe 20 Underground Films You Must See.'\" So the next persons says, \"Clean it up.\" Somebody says, \"I've found it on IMDB.\nKeep, keep, keep.\" And what's interesting about this\nis that the software is -- these votes are just text\ntyped into a page. This is not really a vote\nso much as it is a dialogue. Now it is true that at the end of the day, an administrator can go through here\nand take a look at this and say, \"OK, 18 deletes, two keeps:\nwe'll delete it.\" But in other cases,\nthis could be 18 deletes and two keeps, and we would keep it,\nbecause if those last two keeps say, \"Wait a minute. Nobody else saw this\nbut I found it in a book, and I found a link\nto a page that describes it, and I'm going to clean it up tomorrow,\nso please don't delete it,\" then it would survive. And it also matters\nwho the people are who are voting. Like I say, it's a tight-knit community. Down here at the bottom,\n\"Keep, real movie,\" RickK. RickK is a very famous Wikipedian\nwho does an enormous amount of work with vandalism, hoaxes\nand votes for deletion. His voice carries a lot of weight\nwithin the community because he knows what he's doing. So how is all this governed? People really want to know\nabout administrators, things like that. So the Wikipedia governance model,\nthe governance of the community, is a very confusing,\nbut workable mix of consensus -- meaning we try not to vote\non the content of articles, because the majority view\nis not necessarily neutral -- some amount of democracy -- all of the administrators -- these are the people\nwho have the ability to delete pages. That doesn't mean that they have\nthe right to delete pages. They still have to follow all the rules --\nbut they're elected by the community. Sometimes people --\nrandom trolls on the Internet -- like to accuse me\nof handpicking the administrators to bias the content of the encyclopedia. I always laugh at this, because I have\nno idea how they're elected, actually. There's a certain amount of aristocracy. You got a hint of that\nwhen I mentioned, like, RickK's voice would carry\na lot more weight than someone we don't know. I give this talk sometimes with Angela, who was just re-elected to the board\nfrom the community -- to the Board of the Foundation, with more than twice the votes\nof the person who didn't make it. And I always embarrass her because I say, \"Well, Angela, for example, could get away with doing\nabsolutely anything within Wikipedia, because she's so admired and so powerful.\" But the irony is, of course, that Angela\ncan do this because she's the one person who you know would never, ever\nbreak any rules of Wikipedia. And I also like to say\nshe's the only person who actually knows\nall the rules of Wikipedia, so ... And then there's monarchy, and that's my role\non the community, so ... (Laughter) I was describing this in Berlin once, and the next day\nin the newspaper the headline said, \"I am the Queen of England.\" (Laughter) And that's not exactly what I said, but -- (Laughter) the point is my role in the community -- Within the free software world,\nthere's been a long-standing tradition of the \"benevolent dictator\" model. So if you look at most\nof the major free software projects, they have one single person in charge who everyone agrees\nis the benevolent dictator. Well, I don't like the term\n\"benevolent dictator,\" and I don't think that it's my job\nor my role in the world of ideas to be the dictator of the future\nof all human knowledge compiled by the world. It just isn't appropriate. But there is a need still\nfor a certain amount of monarchy, a certain amount of -- sometimes we have to make a decision and we don't want\nto get bogged down too heavily in formal decision-making processes. So as an example\nof how this can be important: we recently had a situation where\na neo-Nazi website discovered Wikipedia, and they said,\n\"Oh, well, this is horrible, this Jewish conspiracy of a website, and we're going to get certain articles\ndeleted that we don't like. And we see they have a voting process,\nso we're going to send -- we have 40,000 members\nand we're going to send them over and they're all going to vote\nand get these pages deleted.\" Well, they managed\nto get 18 people to show up. That's neo-Nazi math for you. They always think they've got\n40,000 members when they've got 18. But they managed to get 18 people\nto come and vote in a fairly absurd way to delete a perfectly valid article. Of course, the vote ended up\nbeing about 85 to 18, so there was no real danger\nto our democratic processes. On the other hand, people said,\n\"But what are we going to do? I mean, this could happen. What if some group\ngets really seriously organized and comes in and wants to vote?\" Then I said, \"Well, fuck it,\nwe'll just change the rules.\" That's my job in the community: to say we won't allow\nour openness and freedom to undermine the quality of the content. And so, as long as people\ntrust me in my role, then that's a valid place for me. Of course, because of the free licensing, if I do a bad job, the volunteers\nare more than happy to take and leave -- I can't tell anyone what to do. So the final point here\nis that to understand how Wikipedia works, it's important to understand\nthat our wiki model is the way we work, but we are not fanatical web anarchists. In fact, we're very flexible\nabout the social methodology, because ultimately,\nthe passion of the community is for the quality of the work, not necessarily for the process\nthat we use to generate it. Thank you. (Applause) Ben Saunders: Yeah, hi, Ben Saunders. Jimmy, you mentioned impartiality\nbeing a key to Wikipedia's success. It strikes me that much of the textbooks\nthat are used to educate our children are inherently biased. Have you found Wikipedia\nbeing used by teachers and how do you see Wikipedia\nchanging education? Jimmy Wales: Yeah, so, a lot of teachers\nare beginning to use Wikipedia. There's a media storyline about Wikipedia,\nwhich I think is false. It builds on the storyline\nof bloggers versus newspapers. And the storyline is,\nthere's this crazy thing, Wikipedia, but academics hate it\nand teachers hate it. And that turns out to not be true. The last time I got an email\nfrom a journalist saying, \"Why do academics hate Wikipedia?\" I sent it from my Harvard email address because I was recently\nappointed a fellow there. And I said, \"Well,\nthey don't all hate it.\" (Laughter) But I think there's going\nto be huge impacts. And we actually have a project\nthat I'm personally really excited about, which is the Wikibooks project, which is an effort to create\ntextbooks in all the languages. And that's a much bigger project. It's going to take 20 years or so\nto come to fruition. But part of that is to fulfill our mission of giving an encyclopedia\nto every single person on the planet. We don't mean we're going\nto Spam them with AOL-style CDs. We mean we're going to give them\na tool that they can use. And for a lot of people in the world, if I give you an encyclopedia\nthat's written at a university level, it doesn't do you any good\nwithout a whole host of literacy materials to build you up to the point\nwhere you can actually use it. The Wikibooks project\nis an effort to do that. And I think that we're going to see --\nit may not even come from us; there's all kinds of innovation going on. But freely licensed textbooks\nare the next big thing in education."
