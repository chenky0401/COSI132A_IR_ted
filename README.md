# Information Retrieval System for TED
This is an information retrieval system built with [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) and supports multi-field search for people interested in [TED Talks](https://www.ted.com/). User can search for specific speakers or lengths of the talks as well as perform free text search on titles, descriptions, and transcripts. The system also has a [tf-idf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) relevance based recommendation system which shows users realated talks on individual talk page.Please see [here](https://github.com/chenky0401/IR_for_TED/blob/master/WatchaWatching_readme.pdf) for more detailed information.
